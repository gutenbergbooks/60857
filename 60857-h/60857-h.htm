<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>Some years ago, to fill what appeared to me a need in
our literature for children, I made a study of the lives and
campaigns of General R. E. Lee and of General Stonewall
Jackson and prepared, for very young readers, histories
of those great commanders.</p>
<p>In performing these tasks, I became interested in the
combats and maneuvers of General Lee&rsquo;s chief of cavalry,
Major-General J. E. B. Stuart, who has been justly called
&ldquo;the eyes and ears of Lee.&rdquo; As the years go by, I find
no book in print recounting to children his wonderful
feats and valorous service, or explaining to them the part
played in the battles of Lee and Jackson by the Stuart
Cavalry Corps and Horse Artillery whose exploits hold a
brilliant place in modern military tactics.</p>
<p>To make good this omission, I have prepared this little
life of Stuart, in the hope that it will not only pass on the
story of military deeds as captivating as any in history,
but warm the hearts of rising generations to lives of
courage and devotion.</p>
<p>In the later stages of my work, Miss Evelina O. Wiggins
has been associated, contributing various materials, obtaining
three pictures and several interesting letters of
General Stuart&rsquo;s, and making available Mrs. J. E. B.
Stuart&rsquo;s criticism of the manuscript. Miss Wiggins has
also rendered the aid of adapting the book to the practical
needs of the schoolroom. Her experience and position
as a teacher make the latter service highly valuable.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Henry of Navarre was a famous French king
who led his forces to a glorious victory in a
civil war. An English writer, Lord Macaulay,
wrote a stirring poem in which a French soldier
is represented as describing this battle. Here is
his picture of the great, beloved king:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The King is come to marshal us, in all his armor drest,</p>
<p class="t0">And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.</p>
<p class="t0">He looked upon his people and a tear was in his eye,</p>
<p class="t0">He looked upon the traitors and his glance was stern and high;</p>
<p class="t0">Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,</p>
<p class="t0">Down all our line a deafening shout, &lsquo;God save our lord, the King!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;And if my standard bearer fall,&mdash;as fall full well he may,</p>
<p class="t0">For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Press where you see my white plume shine amidst the ranks of war,</p>
<p class="t0">And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,</p>
<p class="t0">A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;</p>
<p class="t0">And in they burst and on they rushed, while like a guiding star,</p>
<p class="t0">Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>These lines about the French king of the
sixteenth century are often quoted in describing
a gallant cavalry leader of our own country.
As we read them, we see the Confederate general,
&ldquo;Jeb&rdquo; Stuart, his cavalry hat looped back on
one side with a long black ostrich plume which
his troopers always saw in the forefront of the
charge. His men would follow that plume
anywhere, at any time, and when you read this
story of his life, you will not wonder that he
inspired their absolute devotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>You have read about the lives of the peerless
commander, General Robert E. Lee, and his
great lieutenant, General Stonewall Jackson. In
these you have learned something about the
movements of the great body of our army, the
infantry; but the infantry, even with such able
commanders as Lee and Jackson, needed the
aid of the cavalry and the artillery. It is with
these two latter divisions of the army that we
deal in studying the life of General Stuart. As
chief of cavalry and commander of the famous
Stuart Horse Artillery, he served as eyes and
ears to the commanding generals. He kept
them informed about the location and movements
of the Federals, screened the location
of the Confederate troops, felt the way, protected
the flank and rear when the army was on
the march, and made quick raids into the
Federal territory or around their army to
secure supplies and information as well as to
mislead them concerning the proposed movements
of Confederate forces. A heavy responsibility
rested on the cavalry, and General
Stuart and his men were engaged in many small
but severe battles and skirmishes in which the
army as a whole did not take part.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">YOUTHFUL DAYS</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1833-&rsquo;54</span></h2>
<p>James Ewell Brown Stuart, commonly known
as &ldquo;Jeb&rdquo; Stuart from the first three initials of
his name, was born in Patrick county, Virginia,
February 6, 1833. On each side of his family,
he could point to a line of ancestors who had
served their country well in war and peace
and from whom he inherited his high ideals of
duty, patriotism, and religion.</p>
<p>He was of Scotch descent and his ancestors
belonged to a clan of note in the history of
Scotland. From Scotland a member of this
clan went to Ireland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>About the year 1726, Jeb Stuart&rsquo;s great-great-grandfather,
Archibald Stuart, fled from
Londonderry, Ireland, to the wilds of Pennsylvania,
in order to escape religious persecution.
Eleven years later, he removed from Pennsylvania
to Augusta county, Virginia, where he
became a large land-holder. At Tinkling Spring
Church, the graves of the immigrant and his
wife may still be seen.</p>
<p>Archibald Stuart&rsquo;s second son, Alexander,
joined the Continental
army and
fought with signal
bravery during the
whole of the War of
the Revolution.
After the war, he
practiced law. He
showed his interest
in education by becoming
one of the
founders of Liberty
Hall, at Lexington,
Virginia, a school which afterwards became
Washington College and has now grown into
Washington and Lee University.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="488" />
<p class="caption">RUINS OF LIBERTY HALL ACADEMY, AT LEXINGTON, VA.</p>
</div>
<p>His youngest son who bore his name, was also
a lawyer; he held positions of trust in his native
State, Virginia, as well as in Illinois and Missouri
where he held the responsible and honored
position of a United States judge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Our general&rsquo;s father, Archibald Stuart, the
son of Judge Stuart, after a brief military
career in the War of 1812, became a successful
lawyer. His wit and eloquence soon won him
distinction, and his district sent him as representative
to the Congress of the United States
where he served four years.</p>
<p>There is an interesting story told about
General Stuart&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s grandfather, William
Letcher. He had enraged the Loyalists, or
Tories, on the North Carolina border, by a
defeat that he and a little company of volunteers
had inflicted on them in the War of the
Revolution. One day in June, 1780, as Mrs.
Letcher was alone at home with her baby girl,
only six weeks old, a stranger, dressed as a
hunter and carrying a gun in his hand, appeared
at the door and asked for Letcher. While his
wife was explaining that he would be at home
in a short time, he entered and asked the man
to be seated.</p>
<p>The latter, however, raised his gun, saying:
&ldquo;I demand you in the name of the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Letcher tried to seize the gun, the Tory
fired and the patriot fell mortally wounded, in
the presence of his young wife and babe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Bethenia Letcher, the tiny fatherless babe,
grew to womanhood and married David Pannill;
and her daughter, Elizabeth Letcher Pannill,
married Archibald Stuart, the father of our
hero.</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald Stuart inherited from her
grandfather, William Letcher, a large estate in
Patrick county. The place, commanding fine
views of the Blue Ridge mountains, was called
Laurel Hill, and here in a comfortable old mansion
set amid a grove of oak trees, Jeb Stuart
was born and spent the earlier years of his
boyhood.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuart was a great lover of flowers and
surrounding the house was a beautiful old-fashioned
flower garden, where Jeb, who loved
flowers as much as his mother did, spent many
happy days. He always loved this boyhood
home and often thought of it during the hard
and stirring years of war. Once near the close
of the war, he told his brother that he would like
nothing better, when the long struggle was at
an end, than to go back to the old home and live
a quiet, peaceful life.</p>
<p>When Jeb was fourteen years old, he was sent
to school in Wytheville, and in 1848 he entered
Emory and Henry College. Here, under the
influence of a religious revival, he joined the
Methodist church, but about ten years later
he became a member of the Episcopal church
of which his wife was a member.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Though always gay and high-spirited, Stuart
even as a boy possessed a deep religious sentiment
which grew in strength as he grew in
years and kept his heart pure and his hands
clean through the many temptations that beset
him in the freedom and conviviality of army
life. A promise that he made his mother never
to taste strong drink was kept faithfully to his
death, and none of his soldiers ever heard him
use an oath even in the heat of battle. His
gallantry, boldness, and continual gayety and
good nature, coupled with his high Christian
virtues, caused all who came in contact with
him not only to love but to respect and admire
him.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="394" />
<p class="caption">EMORY AND HENRY COLLEGE ABOUT 1850</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>He left Emory and Henry College in 1850
and entered the United States Military Academy
at West Point where he had received an appointment.</p>
<p>At this time, Colonel Robert E. Lee was
superintendent at West Point. Young Stuart
spent many pleasant hours at the home of the
superintendent where he was a great favorite
with the ladies of the family. Custis Lee, the
eldest son of Colonel Lee, was Stuart&rsquo;s best
friend while he was a student at the Academy.</p>
<p>An interesting incident is told about Stuart
while he was on a vacation from West Point.
Mr. Benjamin B. Minor of Richmond, had a
case to be tried at Williamsburg, and when he
arrived at the hotel it was so crowded that he
was put in an &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; room, so called
because it contained three double beds.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon when the stage drove
up, he saw three young cadets step from it and
he soon found that they were to share with him
the &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; room.</p>
<p>He went to bed early, but put a lamp on the
table by the head of his bed and got out his
papers to go over his case. After awhile the
three cadets came in laughing and singing, and
soon they were all three piled into one bed
where they continued to laugh and joke in
uproarious spirits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Finally one of them said, &ldquo;See here, fellows,
we have had our fun long enough and we are
disturbing that gentleman over there; let us
hush up and go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need for that, boys,&rdquo; said Mr. Minor,
&ldquo;I have just finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as he tells us he &lsquo;pitched in&rsquo; and had a
good time with them.</p>
<p>The cadet who had shown such thoughtfulness
and courtesy
was young Jeb
Stuart who as Mr.
Minor discovered
was one of his
wife&rsquo;s cousins. He
was very much
pleased with the
boy and invited
him to come to
Richmond. Stuart
accepted the invitation
and called
several times at
the Minor home.</p>

<br />J. E. B. STUART
<br />When a student at West Point</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>He explained to
Mr. Minor his plan for an invention which was
to be called &ldquo;Stuart&rsquo;s lightning horse-hitcher&rdquo;
and to be used in Indian raids. He excited Mr.
Minor&rsquo;s admiration because he had such gallant
and genial courtesy and professional pride. He
wanted even then to accomplish something useful
and important to his country and himself.</p>
<p>General Fitzhugh Lee, who was at West Point
with Stuart, and who later served under General
Stuart as a trusted commander, tells us that as
a cadet he was remarkable
for &ldquo;strict attendance to
military duties, and erect,
soldierly bearing, an immediate
and almost thankful
acceptance of a challenge to
fight any cadet who might
in any way feel himself aggrieved,
and a clear, metallic,
ringing voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the boys called
him a &ldquo;Bible class man&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Beauty Stuart,&rdquo; it
was in good-natured boyish
teasing; where he felt it to
be intended differently or
where his high standards
of conduct seemed to be
sneered at, he was well able with his quick
temper and superb physical strength to teach
the offender a lesson.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>As &lsquo;Fitz&rsquo; Lee tells us, Stuart was always
ready to accept a challenge, but he did not
fight without good cause, and his father, a fair-minded
and intelligent man, approved of his
son&rsquo;s course in these fisticuff encounters. Between
his father and himself there was the best
kind of comradeship and sympathy, and young
Stuart was always ready to consult his father
before taking any important step in life. The
decision as to what he should do when he
left West Point, however, was left to him, and
just after his graduation he wrote home that
he had decided to enter the regular army
instead of becoming a lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each profession has its labors and rewards,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;and in making the selection I shall
rely upon Him whose judgment cannot err,
for it is not with the man that walketh to
direct his steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, by his daring and skill in horsemanship,
his diligence in his studies, and his
ability to command, he had risen rapidly from
the position of corporal to that of captain, and
then to the rank of cavalry sergeant which is
the highest rank in that arm of the service at
West Point. He graduated thirteenth in a
class of forty-six, and started his brief but
brilliant military career well equipped with
youth, courage, skill, and a firm reliance on
the love and wisdom of God.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES CAVALRY</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1854-&rsquo;61</span></h2>
<p>Most of Stuart&rsquo;s time from his graduation at
West Point until the outbreak of the War of
Secession was spent in military service along the
southern and western borders of our country.
During this period, there was almost constant
warfare between Indians and frontier settlers.
Stuart had many interesting adventures in
helping to protect the settlers and to drive the
Indians back into their own territory. The
training that he received at this time helped
to develop him into a great cavalry and artillery
leader.</p>
<p>The autumn after he left West Point, Stuart
was commissioned second lieutenant in a regiment
of mounted riflemen on duty in western
Texas. He reached Fort Clark in December,
just in time to join an expedition against the
Apache Indians who had been giving the
settlers a great deal of trouble. The small force
to which he was attached pushed boldly into
the Indian country north of the Rio Grande.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<div class="img" id="pic6">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="799" />
<p class="caption">CARRYING THE GUN DOWN THE &lsquo;MULEPATH&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was not long before the young officer&rsquo;s
skill and determination received a severe test.
The trail that the expedition followed led to
the top of a steep
and rugged ridge
which to the troopers&rsquo;
astonishment
dropped abruptly
two thousand feet
to an extensive valley.
The precipice
formed of huge columns
of vertical
rock, at first seemed
impassable, but they
soon found a narrow
and dangerous Indian
trail&mdash;the kind
that is called a &lsquo;mulepath&rsquo;&mdash;winding
to
the base of the
mighty cliff. The
officers and advance guard dismounted and led
their horses down the steep path that scarcely
afforded footing for a man and passed on to
choose a bivouac for the night. A little later,
Lieutenant Stuart, with a rear guard of fifty
rangers detailed to assist him, reached the top
of the ridge, with their single piece of artillery.
Stuart worked his way down the trail
alone, hoping that when he reached the foot
he would find that the major in charge of the expedition
had left word that the gun was to be
abandoned as it seemed impossible to carry it
down the precipice. No such order awaited him,
however, and the young officer determined to get
the gun down in spite of all difficulties. He noted
well the dangers of the way as he regained the
top and, having had the mules unhitched and led
down by some of the men, he unlimbered the
gun and started the captain of the rangers
and twenty-five men down with the limber. He
himself took charge of the gun and, with the
help of the remaining men, lifted it over huge
rocks and lowered it by lariat ropes over impassable
places until it was finally brought
safely to the valley below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The major had taken it for granted that
Stuart would leave the gun at the top of the
precipice and was amazed when just at supper
time it was brought safely into camp. Such
ingenuity, grit, and determination were qualities
which promised that the young officer would
develop into a skillful and reliable leader.</p>
<p>A few days later, the command encamped
for the night in a narrow valley between high
ridges. The camp fires were burning brightly
and the cooks were preparing supper when a
sudden violent gust of wind swept through the
valley and scattering the fire set the whole
prairie into a moving flame. With such rapidity
did the fire sweep over the camp that the men
were unable to save anything except their
horses, and in a deplorable condition the expedition
was forced to return to the camp in
Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>In May, 1855, Stuart was transferred to the
First Regiment of cavalry, with the rank of
second lieutenant. In July, this regiment was
ordered to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; and in
September, it went on a raid, under the leadership
of Colonel E. V. Sumner, against some
Indians who had disturbed the white settlers.
The savages retreated to their mountain strongholds
and the regiment returned to the fort
without fighting.</p>
<p>While on this expedition, Stuart learned with
deep distress of the death of his wise and
affectionate father. It had been only a few
weeks before that Mr. Stuart had written to
approve his son&rsquo;s marriage to Miss Flora Cooke,
daughter of Colonel Philip St. George Cooke
who was commandant at Fort Riley. The
marriage was celebrated at that place, November
14, 1855.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>At this time, there was serious trouble in
Kansas between the two political parties that
were fighting to decide whether Kansas should
become a free or a slave state. Stuart, who
had been promoted to the rank of first lieutenant,
was stationed at Fort Leavenworth in 1856-&rsquo;57.
Here he was involved in many skirmishes and
local raids. It was at this time that he encountered
the outlaw &ldquo;Ossawatomie&rdquo; Brown of
whom we shall hear again a little later.</p>
<p>Stuart passed uninjured through the Kansas
contest, and in 1857 entered upon another
Indian war against the Cheyenne warriors who
were attacking the western settlers. In the chief
battle of this campaign, the Indians were
routed, but Lieutenant Stuart was wounded
while rescuing a brother officer who was attacked
by an Indian.</p>
<p>Here is Stuart&rsquo;s own account of the fight as
given in a letter to his wife, which she has
kindly allowed us to copy:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very few of the company horses were fleet
enough after the march, besides my own Brave
Dan, to keep in reach of the Indians mounted
on fresh ponies.... As long as Dan
held out I was foremost, but after a chase of
five miles he failed and I had to mount a
private&rsquo;s horse and continue the pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I overtook the rear of the enemy
again, I found Lomax in imminent danger from
an Indian who was on foot and in the act of
shooting him. I rushed to the rescue, and
succeeded in firing at him in time, wounding
him in his thigh. He fired at me in return with
an Allen&rsquo;s revolver, but missed. My shots
were now exhausted, and I called on some men
approaching to rush up with their pistols and
kill him. They rushed up, but fired without
hitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this time I observed Stanley and
McIntyre close by; the former said, &lsquo;Wait,
I&rsquo;ll fetch him,&rsquo; and dismounted from his horse
so as to aim deliberately, but in dismounting,
his pistol accidentally discharged the last load
he had. He began, however, to snap the empty
barrels at the Indian who was walking deliberately
up to him with his revolver pointed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could not stand that, but drawing my
saber rushed on the monster, inflicting a severe
wound across his head, that I think would have
severed any other man&rsquo;s, but simultaneous with
that he fired his last barrel within a foot of me,
the ball taking effect in the breast, but by the
mercy of God glancing to the left and lodging
so far inside that it cannot be felt. I rejoice
to inform you that it is not regarded as at all
fatal or dangerous, though I may be confined
to my bed for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this battle, all of the force pursued the
Indians, except a small detachment under
Captain Foote, which was left behind to guard
the wounded for whom the surgeon established
rough hospital quarters on the banks of a
beautiful, winding creek. Here Stuart spent
nearly a week confined to his cot, and as he
wrote his wife at the time, the only books that
he had to read during the long, weary days
were his <i>Prayer Book</i> which was not neglected&mdash;and
his <i>Army Regulations</i>. A few pages of
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i> that some one happened to
have were considered quite a treasure.</p>
<p>At the end of about ten days, some Pawnee
guides who had been attached to the expedition
brought orders for this little detachment
to leave the camp where it was exposed to attacks
from the wandering bands of Cheyenne Indians
and go back to Fort Kearny a hundred miles
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Stuart was just able to sit on his horse again,
yet we shall see that in spite of his wound he
was the life and salvation of the little party.
The Pawnees said they were only four days
distant from the fort, but the second day these
unreliable guides deserted and the soldiers were
lost in a heavy fog, without a compass. They
were forced to depend on a Cheyenne prisoner
for information. After four days&rsquo; fruitless and
difficult marching through the forest, Stuart,
who believed that the guard was willfully misleading
them, volunteered to go ahead with a
small force, find the fort, and send back help
for those who were still suffering too seriously
from their wounds to keep up on a rapid and

<br />INDIANS OF THE PLAINS</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>After many dangers and deep anxiety on his
part, taking his course by the stars when the
fog lifted at night and working his way through
it as best he could by day, he finally reached
Fort Kearny. The Pawnees had come in three
days before, and scouting parties had been
searching for Captain Foote&rsquo;s command about
which much anxiety was felt. Help was immediately
sent them, and as a result of Stuart&rsquo;s
indomitable will and able services, the little
party was rescued and brought safely to the fort.</p>
<p>From the autumn of 1857 until the summer of
1860, Stuart was stationed at Fort Riley.
During these three years, there were few skirmishes
with the Indians and Stuart had leisure
to perfect the invention of a saber attachment
that he had been thinking of ever since his
student days at West Point. This invention
was bought and patented by the government in
October, 1859, while the inventor was on leave
of absence in Virginia, visiting his mother and
his friends.</p>
<p>It was on the night of the sixteenth of this
same October that a band of twenty men, under
the leadership of John Brown, seized the United
States arsenal at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. Brown was a
fanatic who believed that all slaves should be
set free and who had taken an active part in
the recent disturbances in Kansas. After
seizing the arsenal at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, he sent
out his followers during the night to arrest
certain citizens and to call to arms the slaves
on the surrounding plantations. About sixty
citizens were arrested and imprisoned in the
engine house, within the confines of the armory,
but the slaves, either through fear or through
distrust of Brown and his schemes, refused to
obey his summons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<div class="img" id="pic8">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="439" />
<p class="caption">ARSENAL AT HARPER&rsquo;S FERRY</p>
</div>
<p>The next morning as soon as news of the
seizure of Harper&rsquo;s Ferry spread over the
country, armed men came against Brown from
all directions. Before night he and his followers
took refuge in the engine house, but it was so
crowded that he
was obliged to
release all but
ten of his prisoners.</p>
<p>When the
news of Brown&rsquo;s
raid was telegraphed
to
Washington,
Lieutenant Stuart,
who was at the capital attending to the sale
of his patent saber attachment, was requested to
bear a secret order to Lieutenant-Colonel Robert
E. Lee, his old superintendent at West Point,
who was then at his home, Arlington, near
Washington city. Stuart learned that Colonel
Lee had been ordered to command the marines
who were being sent to suppress the insurrection
at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, and he at once offered
to act as aid-de-camp. Colonel Lee, who
remembered Stuart well as a cadet, immediately
accepted his offer of service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Upon arriving at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry on the night
of October 17, they found that John Brown and
his men were still in the engine house, defying
the citizen soldiers who surrounded the building.
Colonel Lee proceeded to surround the engine
house with the marines; at daylight, wishing
to avoid bloodshed, he sent Lieutenant Stuart
to demand the surrender of the fanatical men,
promising to protect them from the fury of the
citizens until he could give them up to the
United States government.</p>
<p>When Lieutenant Stuart advanced to the
parley, Brown, who had assumed the name of
Smith, opened the door four or five inches only,
placed his body against it, and held a loaded
carbine in such a position that, as he stated
afterward, he might have &ldquo;wiped Stuart out
like a mosquito.&rdquo; Immediately the young
officer recognized in the so-called Smith the
identical John, or &ldquo;Ossawatomie,&rdquo; Brown who
had caused so much trouble in Kansas. Brown
refused Colonel Lee&rsquo;s terms and demanded
permission to march out with his men and
prisoners and proceed as far as the second tollgate.
Here, he declared, he would free his
prisoners and if Colonel Lee wished to pursue
he would fight to the bitter end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Stuart said that these terms could not be
accepted and urged him to surrender at once.
When Brown refused, Stuart waved his cap, the
signal agreed upon, and the marines advanced,
battered down the doors, and engaged in a hand-to-hand
fight with the insurgents. Ten of
Brown&rsquo;s men were killed by the marines and all
the rest, including Brown himself, were wounded.</p>
<p>That same day, Lieutenant Stuart, under
Colonel Lee&rsquo;s orders, went to a farm about four
miles and a half away that Brown had rented
and brought back a number of pikes with which
Brown had intended to arm the negroes.
Colonel Lee was then ordered back to Washington
and Stuart went with him. John Brown
and seven of his men were tried, were found
guilty of treason, and were hanged.</p>
<p>The John Brown Raid cast a great gloom over
the country. While many people in the North
regarded Brown as a martyr to the cause of
emancipation, the southern people were justly
indignant at the thought that their lives and
property were no longer safe from the plots of
the Abolition party which Brown had represented.
The bitter feelings aroused by this
affair culminated, in 1861, in the bloody War of
Secession.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">A COLONEL OF CONFEDERATE CAVALRY</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1861</span></h2>
<p>There seems to have been no doubt in the
mind of Lieutenant Stuart as to what he should
do in the event of Virginia&rsquo;s withdrawal from
the Union. As soon as he heard that the Old
Dominion had seceded, he forwarded to the War
Department his resignation as an officer in the
United States army, and hastening to Richmond,
he enlisted in the militia of his native
state. Like most other southerners, he preferred
poverty and hardships in defense of the
South to all the honors and wealth which the
United States government could bestow.</p>
<p>On May 10, 1861, Stuart was commissioned as
lieutenant colonel of infantry, and was ordered
to report to Colonel T. J. Jackson at Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry. While he was at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, Stuart
organized several troops of cavalry to assist the
infantry and he was soon transferred to this
branch of the service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>On May 15, General Joseph E. Johnston was
sent by the Confederate government to take
command of all the forces at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry;
while Colonel Jackson, who had previously
been in command of the place, was assigned
charge of the Virginia regiments afterwards
famous as the &ldquo;Stonewall Brigade.&rdquo; General
Johnston found that he was unable to hold the
town against the advancing Federal force; so
he destroyed the railway bridge and retired with
his guns and stores to Bunker Hill, twelve miles
from Winchester, where he offered battle to the
Federals. They declined to fight and withdrew
to the north bank of the Potomac river.</p>
<p>When the Federals under General Patterson
again crossed the river, General Jackson with
his brigade was sent forward to support the
cavalry under Stuart and to destroy the railway
engines and cars at Martinsburg. Jackson then
remained with his brigade near Martinsburg,
while his front was protected by Colonel Stuart
with a regiment of cavalry.</p>
<p>On July 1, General Patterson advanced toward
General Jackson, who went forward to
meet him, with only the Fifth Regiment, several
companies of cavalry, and one piece of artillery.
The Confederate general posted his men behind
a farm house and barn, and held back Patterson
so well that he threw forward an entire division
to overpower the small force of Jackson. The
latter then fell back slowly to the main body
of his troops, with the trifling loss of two men
wounded and nine missing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>While supporting Jackson in this first battle
in the Shenandoah valley, known as the battle
of Haines&rsquo; Farm or Falling Waters, Colonel
Stuart had a remarkable adventure. Riding
alone in advance of his men, he came suddenly
out of a piece of woods at a point where he
could see a force of Federal infantry on the other
side of the fence. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
he rode boldly forward and ordered the
Federal soldiers to pull down the bars.</p>
<p>They obeyed and he immediately rode through
to the other side, and in peremptory tones said,
&ldquo;Throw down your arms or you are dead men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raw troops were so overcome by Stuart&rsquo;s
boldness and commanding tones that they
obeyed at once and then marched as he directed
through the gap in the fence. Before they
recovered from their astonishment, Stuart had
them surrounded by his own force which had
come up in the meantime, thus capturing over
forty men&mdash;almost an entire company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>After some marching backward and forward,
General Johnston retired to Winchester; while
General Patterson moved farther south to Smithfield
as if he intended to attack in that direction.
Stuart with his small force was now
compelled to watch a front of over fifty miles,
in order to report promptly the movements of
the Federals, yet he did this so efficiently that
later on when General Johnston was ordered
west, he wrote to Stuart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I eat, sleep, or rest in peace, without
you upon the outpost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Johnston now received a call for help
from General Beauregard who commanded a
Confederate army of twenty thousand men at
Manassas Junction. Beauregard was confronted
by a Federal army of thirty-five thousand
men, including nearly all of the United
States regulars east of the Rocky Mountains.
This army, commanded by General McDowell,
was equipped with improved firearms and had
fine uniforms, good tents, and everything that
money could buy to make good soldiers. The
North was very proud of this fine army and
fully expected it to crush Beauregard and to
sweep on to Richmond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Beauregard was indeed in danger. He had a
smaller army and his infantry was armed, for
the most part, with old-fashioned smooth-bore
muskets, and his cavalry with sabers and shotguns.
One company of cavalry was armed only
with the pikes of John Brown, which had
been stored at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. Beauregard
stationed his forces in line of battle along the
banks of Bull Run from the Stone Bridge to
Union Mills, a distance of eight miles. On
July 18, the Federals tried to force Blackburn&rsquo;s
Ford on Bull Run, but were repulsed with
heavy loss. Beauregard, knowing that the
attack would be renewed the next day, sent a
message to Johnston at Winchester, sixty miles
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to help me, now is the
time,&rdquo; was Beauregard&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>Two days before, Stuart had been transferred
to the cavalry, with a commission as colonel,
and he entered at once upon his arduous labors.
At first he had in his command only twenty-one
officers and three hundred and thirteen men,
raw to military discipline and poorly armed
with the guns they had used in hunting, but all
were fine horsemen and good shots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>General Johnston, leaving Stuart with a little
band of troopers to conceal his movements,
immediately commenced his march from Winchester
to Manassas. So skillfully did Colonel
Stuart do his work that General Patterson was
not aware of General Johnston&rsquo;s departure
until Sunday, July 21, when the great battle
of Manassas was fought. Owing to a collision
which had blocked the railway, some
of the infantry did not reach Manassas until
near the close of the battle, but the cavalry and
the artillery marched all the way and arrived
in time to render effective service during the
entire battle.</p>
<p>It was at Manassas that General Jackson won
his name of &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; because of the wonderful
stand that his brigade made, just when it
seemed that the Federals were about to overcome
the Confederates. But we are concerned
particularly with the movements of the cavalry
which rendered fine service, protecting each
flank of the army. Colonel Stuart, with only
two companies of cavalry, protected the left
flank from assault after assault. At one time
Stuart boldly charged the Federal right and
drove back a company of Zouaves resplendent
in their blue and scarlet uniforms and white
turbans.</p>
<p>General Early, who arrived on the field about
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon and assisted in
holding the left flank, said, &ldquo;But for Stuart&rsquo;s
presence there, I am of the opinion that my
brigade would have arrived too late to be of any
use. Stuart did as much toward saving the
First Manassas as any subordinate who participated
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>General Jackson, in his report of the battle,
said: &ldquo;Apprehensive lest my flanks be turned,
I sent orders to Colonels Stuart and Radford of
the cavalry to secure them. Colonel Stuart
and that part of his command with him deserve
great praise for the promptness with which they
moved to my left and secured my flank from the
enemy, and by driving them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we see at the very crisis of the battle,
Stuart with only a small force aided largely in
gaining the great victory. When he saw the
Federals fleeing from all parts of the field, he
pursued them for twelve miles, taking many
prisoners and securing much booty.</p>
<p>After the battle of First Manassas, the main
armies were inactive for many months; but the
Confederate cavalry was kept busy in frequent
skirmishes with the Federal pickets and in raids
toward the Potomac river. Stuart took possession
of Munson&rsquo;s Hill, near Washington, and
for several weeks sent out his pickets within
sight of the dome of the Capitol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>In a letter from General F. E. Paxton, of the
Stonewall Brigade, we find this interesting
mention of Colonel Stuart and his life at the
outpost: &ldquo;Yesterday I was down the road
about ten miles, and, from a hill in the possession
of our troops, had a good view of the
dome of the Capitol, some five or six miles
distant. The city was not visible, because
of the woods coming between. I saw the sentinel
of the enemy in the field below me, and
about half a mile off and not far on this side,
our own sentinels. They fire sometimes at
each other. Mrs. Stuart, wife of the colonel
who has charge of our outpost, visits him occasionally&mdash;having
a room with friends a few
miles inside the outpost. Whilst there looking
at the Capitol, I saw two of his little children
playing as carelessly as if they were at home.
A dangerous place, you will think, for women
and children.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic9">

<p class="caption">PICKETED CAVALRY HORSE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Mrs. Stuart, however, was a soldier&rsquo;s daughter
and a soldier&rsquo;s wife, and she took advantage of
every opportunity to be with her husband at
his headquarters. During the beginning of the
war, before the engagements with the Federals
became frequent, she was often able to be with
her husband or to board at some home near
which he was stationed. Although he was a
favorite with women, there was no woman
who, in General Stuart&rsquo;s eyes, could compare
with his wife, and he was never happier than
when with her and his children. When the
general&rsquo;s duties compelled him to be away
from her, two days seldom passed that Mrs.
Stuart did not hear from him by letter or
telegram.</p>
<p>On September 11, Stuart&rsquo;s forces encountered
a raiding party which was forced to retire with
a loss of two killed and thirteen wounded, while
Stuart lost neither man nor horse.</p>
<p>During the summer, Stuart had been ordered
to report to General James Longstreet who
commanded the advance of the Confederate
army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>General Longstreet in a letter to President
Davis said of Stuart: &ldquo;He is a rare man,
wonderfully endowed by nature with the qualities
necessary for an officer of light cavalry.
Calm, firm, acute, active, and enterprising, I
know no one more competent than he to estimate
events at their true value. If you add a
brigade of cavalry to this army, you will find
no better brigadier general to command it.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">A BRIGADIER GENERAL: THE PENINSULAR CAMPAIGN AND THE CHICKAHOMINY RAID</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1861-&rsquo;62</span></h2>
<p>On September 24, 1861, Stuart received his
promotion as brigadier general. His brigade
included four Virginia regiments, one North
Carolina regiment, and
the Jeff Davis Legion
of Cavalry. These regiments
were composed
of high-spirited, brave
young men who could
ride dashingly and shoot
with the skill of backwoodsmen,
but who
were for the most part
untrained in military
affairs. Stuart, however, was an untiring drillmaster
and by his personal efforts he developed
his brigade into a command of capable and
devoted soldiers.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic10">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="498" />
<p class="caption">STUART&rsquo;S GAUNTLETS
<br />From originals in Confederate Museum, Richmond, Va.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The young general was not yet twenty-nine
years old. He was of medium height, had
winning blue eyes, long silken bronze beard
and mustache, and a musical voice. He usually
wore gauntlets, high cavalry boots, a broad-brimmed
felt hat caught up on
one side by a black ostrich plume,
and a tight-fitting cavalry coat
that he called his &ldquo;fighting
jacket.&rdquo; He rode as if he had
been born in the saddle.</p>
<p>Fitz Lee, who
served under him,
said: &ldquo;His strong
figure, his big brown
beard, his piercing,
laughing blue eyes,
the drooping hat and
black feather, the
&lsquo;fighting jacket&rsquo; as he termed it, the tall cavalry
boots, formed one of the most jubilant
and striking pictures in the war.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic11">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="570" />
<p class="caption">STUART&rsquo;S CAVALRY BOOTS
<br />From originals in Confederate Museum, Richmond, Va.</p>
</div>
<p>Later on, John Esten Cooke described Stuart
thus: &ldquo;His &lsquo;fighting jacket&rsquo; shone with dazzling
buttons, and was covered with gold braid; his
hat was looped up with a golden star and
decorated with a black ostrich plume; his fine
buff gauntlets reached to the elbow; around his
waist was tied a splendid yellow sash and his
spurs were of pure gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>One who formed an opinion of him from a
casual glance might have thought that he was
merely a gay young fop, fond of handsome and
even showy dress. But his friends and his
enemies knew better. Gay and even boyish
as he was when off duty, loving music and good
cheer, his men knew that the instant the
bugles called him he would become the calm,
daring, farsighted commander, leading them to
glorious deeds. No leader of the southern army
was more feared by the Federal troops or more
admired by the commanders of the Federal
cavalry&mdash;Sheridan, Pleasanton, Buford, and
others&mdash;than Stuart whom they nicknamed
&ldquo;the Yellow Jacket.&rdquo; He seemed to fly from
place to place, guarding the Confederate line
and charging the Federals at the most unexpected
times and places; gayly dressed as that
brilliant-colored insect, he was as sharp and
sudden in attack.</p>
<p>Possessing the daring courage that is necessary
for a great cavalry leader, he was so wary and
farsighted that he won the respect of conservative
leaders as well as the confidence of his men.
And in victory or defeat he was the soul of good
cheer. His mellow musical voice could be
heard above the din of battle singing,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;If you want to have a good time</p>
<p class="t0">Jine the cavalry.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Once General Longstreet laughingly ordered
General Stuart to leave camp, saying he made
the cavalrymen&rsquo;s life seem so attractive that
all the infantrymen wanted to desert and &ldquo;jine
the cavalry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On December 20, 1861, while the army was
in winter quarters at Manassas, Stuart was
placed in command of about 1,500 infantry,
a battery of artillery, and a small body of
cavalry, for the purpose of covering the movements
of General J. E. Johnston&rsquo;s wagon train
which had been sent to procure forage for the
Confederate troops. It was most important
that this wagon train should be protected and
the pickets had advanced to Dranesville with
the cavalry following closely, when a Federal
force of nearly 4,000 men, supported by two
other brigades, attacked the pickets. The
pickets were driven back, and the Federal
artillery and infantry occupied the town, where
they posted themselves in a favorable position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Stuart, when informed that the Federals held
the town, sent at once to recall the wagons and
advanced as quickly as possible with the rest
of his force to engage the Federals while the
wagons were gaining a place of safety. The
Federals had a much larger force of infantry
and had a good position for their artillery; so
Stuart, after two hours of unequal combat, was
forced to retire with heavy loss in killed and
wounded. The wagons, however, were saved
from capture; and the next morning when
Stuart returned to renew the attack, he found
that the Federals had retired.</p>
<p>In this battle of Dranesville, the Confederate
loss was nearly 200 and that of the Federals
was only 68. This was the first serious check
that Stuart had received, but he had displayed
so much prudence and skill in extricating the
wagons and his small force from the sudden
danger that he retained the entire confidence
of his men.</p>
<p>Writing about this battle to his wife, Stuart
said, &ldquo;The enemy&rsquo;s force was at least four
times larger than mine. Never was I in greater
personal danger. Horses and men fell about
me like tenpins, but thanks to God neither I
nor my horse was touched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the Federal commander,
General McClellan, had been organizing his
forces and by March, 1862, he had under him
in front of Washington a large army splendidly
armed and equipped. General Johnston had
too small an army to engage the Federal hosts;
and so late in March he fell back from Manassas
and encamped on the south side of the Rappahannock
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>General McClellan moved his large army to
Fortress Monroe, and it was then seen that he
intended to advance to Richmond by way of
the Peninsula,&mdash;that is, the portion of tidewater
Virginia lying between the James and York
rivers.</p>
<p>The brave Confederate general, Magruder,
stationed at Yorktown, was joined by General
Johnston with his whole army. They saw, however,
that it would be impossible to hold that
position against McClellan, and so the Confederates
gave up the town and retired toward
Richmond.</p>
<p>The cavalry under Stuart skillfully guarded
the rear of the army and concealed its movements
from the Federals. At Williamsburg a
stubborn and brilliant battle was fought, in
which Johnston&rsquo;s rear guard repelled the
Federals. After the battle, the cavalry and the
Stuart Horse Artillery protected the rear of the
Confederate army as it withdrew toward
Richmond and screened the infantry as it took
position along the southern bank of the Chickahominy
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>McClellan placed his army on the north bank
of the same river, and on May 31 and June 1,
he threw a large force across the river and
engaged the army of Johnston in the battle of
Seven Pines. This battle was only a partial victory
for the Confederates, and as the river was
bordered by wide marshes and dense woods,
neither side could make use of cavalry in the
conflict. General Stuart, however, was actively
engaged in giving personal assistance to General
Longstreet on the field.</p>
<p>In his report of the battle, General Longstreet
said: &ldquo;Brigadier J. E. B. Stuart, in the absence
of any opportunity to use his cavalry, was of
material service by his presence with me on the
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this battle of Seven Pines, General Johnston
was severely wounded and gave place to
General R. E. Lee, who was thus put in command
of the army defending Richmond and of
all of the other Confederate forces in Virginia.
McClellan&rsquo;s magnificent army, now numbering
115,000 men, stretched from Meadow Bridge on
the right to the Williamsburg Road on the left,
having in front the marshes of the Chickahominy
as natural barriers. By entrenching his army
behind positions which he secured from time to
time, he advanced until at one point he was only
five miles from Richmond and could see the
spires of the churches and hear the bells ringing
for services.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>General Lee had a much smaller army with
which to repel this large entrenched army and
he withdrew to the south side of the Chickahominy.
It was very important to him to
learn the position and strength of the Union
forces, so that he might be able to attack them
at the weakest point. In order to gain this
information, he resolved to send General Stuart
with 1,200 cavalry to make a raid toward the
White House on the Pamunkey river, which
was the base of supplies for the Federal troops.
General Lee wrote to General Stuart, giving
definite instructions about this scouting expedition.</p>
<p>The letter said: &ldquo;You are desired to make a
scout movement, to the rear of the enemy now
posted on the Chickahominy river, with a view
of gaining intelligence of his operations, communications,
etc., of driving in his foraging
parties, and securing such grain and cattle for
ourselves as you can make arrangements to
have driven in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another object is to destroy his wagon trains
said to be daily passing from the Piping-Tree
road to his camp on the Chickahominy. The
utmost vigilance on your part will be necessary
to prevent any surprise to yourself, and the
greatest caution must be practiced in keeping
well in your front and flanks reliable scouts to
give you information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will return as soon as the object of your
expedition is accomplished, and you must bear
in mind while endeavoring to execute the
general purpose of your mission, not to hazard
unnecessarily your command. Be content to
accomplish all the good you can, without feeling
it necessary to obtain all that might be desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a raid demanded great daring and skill,
coupled with cool judgment, and General Lee
knew that these qualities were possessed by the
man to whom he entrusted this responsible and
dangerous undertaking. As we are to see,
Stuart carried out his instructions in an able
and brilliant manner and accomplished even
more than was hoped by General Lee.</p>
<p>In the first place, Stuart chose for the enterprise
men and horses picked to stand the strain
of rapid movement. Colonel Fitzhugh Lee,
Colonel W. H. F. Lee, and Colonel W. T. Martin
were in command of the cavalry and Colonel
James Breathed commanded the one battery
of artillery.</p>

<p class="caption">MAP OF THE CHICKAHOMINY RAID</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Early on the morning of June 12, Stuart
and his chosen troopers started on the famous
&ldquo;Chickahominy Raid,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pamunkey Expedition&rdquo;
as it is sometimes called. In order
to mask his real purpose, Stuart marched
directly northward twenty-two miles. At sunrise
the next morning, the little band of horsemen
mounted and turned abruptly eastward
toward Hanover Courthouse. They found the
town in possession of a body of Federal cavalry
that retired as the Confederate troopers advanced.
The Confederates then passed on
without serious trouble as far as Totopotomy
Creek. Here, however, Stuart&rsquo;s advance guard
was attacked by a company of Federal troopers.
Finding themselves outnumbered and almost
surrounded, these troopers retired to the main
body of Federal troops commanded by Captain
Royall, who at once drew up his forces to
receive the attack. Stuart immediately ordered
a squadron to charge with sabers, in columns of
fours. Captain Latan&eacute;, a gallant young officer
who was that day commanding the squadron,
met Captain Royall in a hand-to-hand encounter.
Royall was seriously wounded by a
thrust from Latan&eacute;&rsquo;s saber. Latan&eacute; fell dead,
pierced by a bullet from Royall&rsquo;s pistol. The
Federals fled in dismay, but soon rallied and
returned to the charge, only to be again repulsed,
whereupon they retired to the Union lines.</p>
<p>Fitz Lee learned from some of the prisoners
that the Federal camp was not far away and,
having obtained from Stuart permission to pursue
the Union troops, he pushed onto Old Church,
repelled the cavalry, and destroyed the camp.</p>

<br />THE BURIAL OF LATAN&Eacute;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>General Stuart had now carried out the chief
order given by General Lee,&mdash;that is, he had
ridden to the rear of McClellan&rsquo;s army and had
discovered that the Federal right wing did not
extend toward the railway and Hanover Courthouse&mdash;but
it was a vexing problem how to
bring this valuable information to his commanding
general. The route the young officer
had just passed was doubtless by this time
swarming with Federals. The best way to return
to Richmond would probably be to ride quickly
around the entire Federal army and cross the
Chickahominy river to the left of McClellan,
before troops were sent to cut him off. Without
halting or consulting with any of his officers,
Stuart decided that there was less risk in
following this circuitous route, especially as he
had with him for a guide Lieutenant James
Christian whose home was on the Chickahominy
and who said that the command could safely
cross a private ford on his farm.</p>
<p>The Federals were under the impression that
there was a very large force of Confederates on
the raid; and so they were collecting infantry
and cavalry at Totopotomy Bridge to cut off
the return of the raiders. Stuart, however,
passed on toward Tunstall&rsquo;s Station, on the
York River Railroad, four miles from the
White House which was the principal supply
station of the Federal army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>He now proceeded to carry out the second
part of Lee&rsquo;s instructions,&mdash;namely, to destroy
whatever supplies he might find on the way.
As he passed on, numbers of wagons fell into his
hands. He sent two squadrons to Putney&rsquo;s
Ferry and burned two large transports and
numbers of wagons laden with supplies. Approaching
Tunstall&rsquo;s Station, one of the supply
depots of the Federals, he sent forward a body
of picked men to cut the telegraph wires and
obstruct the railroad. Before they could perform
the latter task, a train approached bearing
soldiers and supplies to McClellan&rsquo;s army. The
Confederates fired on it, but instead of stopping
the brave engineer stood at his post and carried
the train by at full speed. He was struck by a
shot and fell dying at his post, while the Confederates
gave a cheer for his courage in risking
his life to save his charge from their hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Vast quantities of Federal stores were destroyed
by the Confederates whose men and
horses reveled in an unusual supply of good
rations and provender. It was now nearly dark
and Stuart&rsquo;s position was exceedingly dangerous.
Behind him were regiments of cavalry in hot
pursuit. Not more than four or five miles
distant were the entrenchments of McClellan,
whence in a short time troops could be sent by
rail to cut off his progress to the James river.
Before him was the Chickahominy, now a
raging torrent from the spring rains. His chief
guides through this maze of swamps and forest
roads were Private Richard Frayser and Lieutenant
Christian whose homes were near and
who knew every part of the country through
which they were passing. Stuart had the advantage
also of knowing from his scouts just
where the enemy was located.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic14">

<p class="caption"><span class="jr">From a war-time photograph</span>
<br />THE CHICKAHOMINY RIVER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Having formed his plans, swiftness and
boldness were his watchwords. After he had
destroyed the Federal supplies at Tunstall&rsquo;s
Station and burned the railroad bridge over
Black Creek, he set out about dark for Talleysville,
four miles distant, where he halted for
three hours and a half, in order to allow men
and horses to rest and scattered troopers to
come up.</p>
<p>Colonel John S. Mosby, later one of Stuart&rsquo;s
chief scouts, was at that time his aide. In
describing the raid, Mosby said that one who
had never taken part in such an expedition
could form no idea of the careless gayety of the
men that night. When they had set out the day
before, they did not know where they were
going. Now they were aware they were riding
around McClellan and the boldness of the
movement fired their imaginations, quickened
their pulses, and roused their courage to any
deed of daring. Therefore, in the midst of
danger, they sang and laughed and feasted; and
at midnight when the bugle sounded &ldquo;Boots
and Saddles,&rdquo; every horseman was ready for
whatever might come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>At daybreak on June 14, the Confederates
reached the ford on Sycamore Springs, Christian&rsquo;s
farm,&mdash;a ford no longer for the river
swollen by the heavy rains had overflowed its
banks and become a raging torrent. Colonel
Lee and a few men swam their horses across
the stream and back again; but it was evident
that the weaker horses and the artillery could
not cross at that point. The Confederates then
cut down trees tall enough to span the stream,
and attempted to build a rough bridge, but the
trees were swept down the rapid current as
soon as they touched the water.</p>
<p>Stuart rode up and sat on his horse, calmly
stroking his long silken beard as he watched his
cavalrymen&rsquo;s bootless efforts. Every other
face betrayed keen anxiety. Learning there
was the remains of an old bridge a few miles
below, he moved the command thither with all
speed. A deserted warehouse was near the old
bridge, and a large force of men was set at work
to tear down the house in order to secure material
to rebuild the bridge. While the work was
going on, Stuart laughed and jested with his
officers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The men worked with such swiftness that
within three hours the bridge was ready for
the cavalry and artillery to pass over; and at
one o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, the whole command
had crossed. During those hours of anxiety,
Fitz Lee, in command of the rear guard, had
driven off several parties of Federal cavalry.
After all the Confederates gained the southern
shore&mdash;Fitz Lee being the last man to cross&mdash;, the
bridge was burned to prevent pursuit. The
men were exultant and happy at having crossed
the river, but they were by no means out of
danger, being thirty-five miles from Richmond
and still far within the lines of McClellan.
Stuart, who knew that every moment was
precious to General Lee, hastened on at sunset
with only one courier and his trusty guide
Frayser and arrived at Richmond about sunrise
on the morning of June 15. The men rested
several hours and then were led by Colonel
Fitz Lee safely back to their own camp where
they were greeted with enthusiastic cheers by
their comrades.</p>
<p>As soon as General Stuart reached Richmond,
he sent Frayser to inform Mrs. Stuart of his
safe return, while he himself rode to General
Lee&rsquo;s headquarters with his wonderful report.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>He had been sent to find out the position of
the right wing of McClellan&rsquo;s army. He had
not only located that, but he had destroyed a
large amount of United States property, brought
off one hundred and sixty-five prisoners and
two hundred and sixty horses and mules. With
only twelve hundred men, he had ridden around
the great Federal army&mdash;a distance of about
ninety miles in about fifty-six hours&mdash;with the
loss of only one man, the lamented young
Latan&eacute;. By that dashing ride, Stuart gained
for himself world-wide fame and an honorable
place among the great cavalry leaders of all
time. The Chickahominy Raid was one of the
most brilliant cavalry achievements in history,
and it inspired the Confederates with fresh
courage and excited Federal dread of the bold
cavalrymen who attempted and accomplished
seemingly impossible things.</p>
<p>The information gained was invaluable for it
made it possible for General Lee to send Jackson
against the right flank of McClellan and to
defeat the Federals at Cold Harbor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>In the Seven Days&rsquo; Battle around Richmond,
which began on June 26, Stuart at first guarded
the left of Jackson&rsquo;s march. In the battle of
Gaines&rsquo;s Mill, he found a suitable position for
the artillery. He sent forward two guns under
Pelham, a gallant young gunner from Alabama,
who kept up an unequal combat for hours
with two Federal batteries. When the Federal
lines had been forced at Gaines&rsquo;s Mill and
Cold Harbor, Stuart advanced three miles to
the left; but finding no trace of the Federals, he
returned that night to Cold Harbor. On June
28, he proceeded toward the White House on
the Pamunkey river, which the Federals had
abandoned and burned. They had also set
fire to many valuable stores and munitions of
war. The illustration on this page is from a
war-time photograph, showing the railroad bridge
across the Pamunkey river which was destroyed
in order to render the road useless to the Confederates.
When McClellan changed his base
from the White House to James river, he had two
trains loaded with food and ammunition run at
full speed off the embankment in the left foreground
into the river, in order to keep these stores
from falling into the hands of the southern
troops.</p>

<br />RUINS OF RAILROAD BRIDGE ACROSS PAMUNKEY RIVER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>An interesting account of this campaign is
given by Heros Von Borcke. Von Borcke was a
noble young Prussian officer who gave his
services as a volunteer to the Confederacy, just
as LaFayette had given his services to the
Colonies in the War of the Revolution; Von
Borcke served the South so loyally that near
the close of the war the Confederate Congress
drew up a resolution of thanks for his services
in just the same form that the Colonies had
thanked LaFayette.</p>
<p>Von Borcke was one of Stuart&rsquo;s aides and he
distinguished himself by his gallantry during
the Chickahominy raid. He tells us that when
the Confederates arrived at the White House
they found burning pyramids built of barrels
of eggs, bacon and hams, and barrels of sugar.
There were also boxes of oranges and lemons
and other luxuries. Many of these luxuries
were rescued by the Confederates, and when
Von Borcke reached the plantation, shortly
after it had been taken, he found General
Stuart seated under a tree drinking a big glass
of iced lemonade, an unusual treat for a Confederate
soldier. All of Stuart&rsquo;s troops had such
a feast as was seldom enjoyed during the war,
and large quantities of supplies and equipments
were forwarded to the Confederate quartermaster
at Richmond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The Federal gunboat, <i>Marblehead</i>, was still
in sight on the river. The soldiers at that
period had an almost superstitious fear of the
bombs thrown by the big guns of the gunboats,
which made an awful whizzing noise and burst
into many fragments. Stuart decided that he
would teach his troopers a lesson and show them
how little harm the dreaded shells did at short
range. He selected seventy-five men whom
he armed with carbines and placed under
command of Colonel W. H. F. Lee who led
them down to the landing. They fired at the
boat and skirmishers were sent ashore from
the boat to meet them. A brisk skirmish followed,
during which Stuart brought up one gun
of Pelham&rsquo;s battery. This threw shells upon the
decks of the <i>Marblehead</i>, while the screeching
bombs of the big guns of the boat went over
the heads of Pelham&rsquo;s battery, far away into
the depths of the swamps. The skirmishers
hurried back to the <i>Marblehead</i>, and it steamed
away down the river, pursued as far as possible
by shells from Pelham&rsquo;s plucky little howitzer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Stuart sent General Lee the important news
that McClellan was seeking a base upon the
James river, and then stayed the remainder of
the day at the White House, where he found
enough undestroyed provisions to satisfy the
hunger of the men and horses of his command.</p>
<p>After severe engagements with the Confederates
at Savage Station and Frayser&rsquo;s Farm, the
Union forces were forced to retreat, closely
followed by Jackson and Stuart. On the evening
of July 1, was fought the bloody battle of
Malvern Hill, after which McClellan retreated
by night down the James to Harrison&rsquo;s Landing
where he was protected by the gunboats.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of July 2, Stuart
started in pursuit and found the Federals in
position at Westover. The next day he took
possession of Evelington Heights, a tableland
overlooking McClellan&rsquo;s encampment and protecting
his line of retreat. Here Stuart expected
to be supported by Longstreet and Jackson, and
he opened fire with Pelham&rsquo;s howitzer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The Federal infantry and artillery at once
moved forward to storm the heights. Jackson
and Longstreet were delayed by terrific storms,
and Stuart unsupported held his position until
two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when his ammunition
gave out. He then retired and joined the
main body of the infantry, which did not arrive
until after the Federals had taken possession
of Evelington Heights and were fortifying it
strongly.</p>
<p>The two armies now had a breathing spell of
about one month. McClellan&rsquo;s defeated hosts
remained in their protected position at Harrison&rsquo;s
Landing until the middle of August, when
they were recalled to join General Pope at
Manassas. General Lee&rsquo;s army was withdrawn
nearer to Richmond which was saved from immediate
danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2">A MAJOR GENERAL: CAMP LIFE AND THE SECOND BATTLE OF MANASSAS</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1862</span></h2>
<p>As a reward for his faithful and efficient
services in the Peninsular Campaign, Stuart
received his commission as major general of
cavalry on July 25, 1862. His forces were now
organized into two brigades, with Brigadier-General
Wade Hampton in command of the
first and Brigadier-General Fitzhugh Lee in
command of the second. During the month
following the defeat of McClellan, these two
brigades were placed by turns on picket duty on
the Charles City road to guard Richmond and
in the camp of instruction at Hanover Courthouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>While conducting this camp of instruction
where he drilled his men in the cavalry tactics
that were later to win them such honor, Stuart
and his staff were often pleasantly entertained
at neighboring plantations. Mrs. Stuart with
her two little children, Flora, five years of age,
and &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; aged two, was able to be near
the general once more. The time passed
pleasantly, enlivened by cavalry drills, visits
from the young officers to the ladies of the
vicinity, serenades and dances, and visits from
the ladies to the general&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>
<p>One Sunday evening as the general and most
of his staff were visiting at Dundee, the plantation
near which their camp was situated, a
stable in the yard caught fire and the visitors
proved themselves as good firemen as they were
soldiers. The young Prussian officer, Von
Borcke, an unusually large and heavily-built
man, was so energetic in his efforts, that after
the fire was out, the general, who was always
fond of a joke, insisted that he had seen the
young officer rush from the burning building
with a mule under one arm and two little pigs
under the other.</p>
<p>Stuart was soon called away from this
pleasant life to make an inspection of all the
Confederate cavalry forces. It was evident
that General Lee&rsquo;s army would soon be engaged
against a new Federal commander, General
Pope, who was concentrating a large army on
the Rapidan river. General Jackson, who had
been sent to hold General Pope in check, had
his headquarters at Gordonsville.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Major Von Borcke tells us that the cars
carrying the Confederate troops to Gordonsville
were so crowded that General Stuart rode
on the tender of the engine, rather than take
a seat away from one of the soldiers. It was a
hot night in July and there was a dense smoke
from the engine, but it was so dark that it was
not until they reached Gordonsville that the
general discovered that both Von Borcke and
himself were so black with soot that their best
friends would not have recognized them.
Indeed, it took a great deal of soap and water
to make them presentable once more.</p>
<p>Stuart reached Jackson&rsquo;s headquarters on
August 10, the day after the Federal advance
guard had been defeated in the battle of Cedar
Run. At Jackson&rsquo;s request, Stuart took command
of a reconnaissance to find out the position
and strength of the enemy. Upon hearing
his report, Jackson decided to remain for the
present on the defensive.</p>
<p>In the meantime, General Lee, who was
watching General McClellan&rsquo;s army still encamped
at Harrison&rsquo;s Landing, received information
that the latter had been ordered to withdraw
his forces and join General Pope at Manassas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Leaving a small force in front of Richmond,
Lee hastened to join Jackson so that they could
engage Pope before his already large army was
reenforced by McClellan. The cavalry was
kept very busy at this time as it was necessary
to defend the Central Road, now the Chesapeake
and Ohio, from Federal raids.</p>
<p>On the night of August 17, Stuart himself
barely escaped capture. He wrote an interesting
account of this adventure to his wife, and Mrs.
Stuart has kindly allowed us to use the letter
in this book. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">Rapidan Valley, August 19, 1862.</span></p>
<p>My Dear Wife&mdash;I had a very narrow escape yesterday
morning. I had made arrangement for Lee&rsquo;s Brigade to
move across from Davenport&rsquo;s bridge to Raccoon ford
where I was to meet it, but Lee went by Louisa Court
House. His dispatch informing me of the fact did not
reach me, consequently I went down the Plank road to
the place of rendezvous.</p>
<p>Hearing nothing of him, I stopped for the night and
sent Major Fitzhugh with a guide across to meet General
Lee. At sunrise yesterday a large body of cavalry from
the very direction from which Lee was expected, approached
crossing the Plank road just below me and
going directly towards Raccoon ford. Of course I thought
it was Lee&mdash;as no Yankees had been seen about for a
month, but as a measure of prudence I sent down two
men to ascertain. They had not gone 100 yards before
they were fired on and pursued rapidly by a squadron.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<div class="img" id="pic16">

<p class="caption">FACSIMILE OF PAGE OF LETTER FROM GENERAL STUART TO HIS WIFE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I was in the yard bareheaded, my hat being in the
porch. I just had time to mount my horse and clear the
back fence, having no time to get my hat or anything
else. I lost my haversack, blanket, talma, cloak, and
<i>hat</i>, with that <i>palmetto star</i>&mdash;too bad, wasn&rsquo;t it? I am
all right again, however, and I am greeted, on all sides
with congratulations and &ldquo;<i>where&rsquo;s your hat!</i>&rdquo; I intend
to make the Yankees pay for that hat.</p>
<p>Poor Fitzhugh was not so fortunate. He was captured
four miles off under similar circumstances, with his fine
grey. He will be exchanged in ten days, however. Von
Borcke and Dabney were with me (five altogether) and
their escape was equally miraculous. Dundee is the best
place for you at present. We will have hot work I
think to-morrow. My cavalry has an important part to
play.</p>
<p>Love to all, my two sweethearts included.</p>
<p><span class="center">God bless you.</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">J. E. B. Stuart.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days later, as you will hear, General
Stuart collected payment for his lost hat from
General Pope himself. But before this took
place, the Confederate cavalry was engaged in
several skirmishes with the Federals. There
was a severe encounter at Brandy Station on
August 20 when sixty-five prisoners were
captured. The regiments which had fought
under Ashby, a gallant young officer who had
been killed in the Valley, were now added to
Stuart&rsquo;s division as Robertson&rsquo;s Brigade. At
Brandy Station, these troopers fought under
Stuart for the first time and he was much
pleased at their dash and bravery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>While Lee, who had now joined Jackson,
was waiting a favorable opportunity to attack
the Federals, Stuart begged permission to pass
to the rear of Pope&rsquo;s army and cut his line of
communication at Catlett&rsquo;s Station where there
was a large depot of supplies. General Lee
gave his consent, and on the morning of
August 22, General Stuart crossed the Rappahannock
at Waterloo Bridge, to make a second
raid to the rear of the Federal army.</p>
<p>By nightfall the Confederates reached Auburn
near Catlett&rsquo;s Station, where they captured
the Federal pickets. Just as they reached the
station, however, a violent storm arose; and
amid the wind and the rain and the darkness, it
seemed impossible to find their way. Fortunately,
they captured a negro who knew Stuart
and who offered to show them the way to Pope&rsquo;s
headquarters. They accepted his guidance and
soon the Confederate cavalry surprised the unsuspecting
enemy, attacked the camp, and
captured a number of officers belonging to
Pope&rsquo;s staff, as well as his horses, baggage, a
large sum of money, and his dispatch book which
contained copies of the letters he had written
to the government, telling the location and
plans of his army. But for the fact that General
Pope was out on a tour of inspection, he himself
would have been captured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<div class="img" id="pic17">

<p class="caption"><span class="jr">From a war-time sketch by Harper&rsquo;s Artist</span>
<br />CATLETT&rsquo;S STATION
<br /><i>Catlett&rsquo;s Station where Stuart made a raid and captured Pope&rsquo;s baggage, Au-R. Ward</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>In the meantime, two of Stuart&rsquo;s regiments
had gained another part of the camp, and an
attempt was made to destroy the railroad
bridge over Cedar Run. But on account of the
heavy rain it was impossible to fire it, and, in
the dense darkness, it was equally hard to cut
asunder the heavy timbers with the few axes
which they found. Therefore, with more than
three hundred prisoners and valuable spoils,
Stuart retired before daybreak and regained in
safety the Confederate lines.</p>
<p>Major Von Borcke gives an interesting incident
of their return march. As the troops&mdash;wet,
cold, and hungry&mdash;passed through Warrenton,
coffee was served them by a number of
young girls. One of the girls recognized among
the prisoners General Pope&rsquo;s quartermaster.
He had boasted several days before, when at
her father&rsquo;s house, that he would enter Richmond
within a month. She had promptly bet
him a bottle of wine that he would not be able
to do it, but as he was now a prisoner he would
be obliged to enter the city even earlier than
he had hoped. She, therefore, asked General
Stuart&rsquo;s permission to offer the quartermaster
a bottle of wine from his own captured supplies.
The general readily granted her request, and the
Yankee prisoner entered good-naturedly into
the jest, saying that he would always be willing
to drink the health of so charming a person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>In retaliation for the loss of his hat and cloak,
General Stuart sent General Pope&rsquo;s uniform
to Richmond where for some days it hung in
one of the shop windows, to the delight of the
populace who especially disliked Pope on account
of his bombast and cruelty. He had
boasted that he had come from the West where
his soldiers always saw the backs of their
enemies, and he had authorized his soldiers to
take whatever they wished from the citizens of
Virginia, whom he held responsible for damage
done by raiding parties of the Confederate army.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, General Stuart wrote his wife
that Parson Landstreet, a member of his staff
who had been captured by the Federals, brought
him a message from General Pope. Pope said
that he would send back Stuart&rsquo;s hat if Stuart
would return his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; wrote Stuart, &ldquo;I have got to see my
hat first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>It was against General Pope that the second
Battle of Manassas was fought, August 28, 29,
and 30, 1862. General Stuart and his cavalry
in the maneuvers preceding the battle, screened
the flank march of Jackson&rsquo;s troops to Grovetown,
by which movement they placed themselves
between the Federal rear and Washington.
It took two days for Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;foot
cavalry&rdquo; to make this march, and so perfectly
did Stuart do his work that as late as August
28, Pope did not know to what place Jackson had
marched from Manassas.</p>
<p>In the three days&rsquo; battle that followed, the
cavalry was ever on the flank of the army,
observing the Federals and guarding against
attacks. On the morning of August 29, after a
sharp skirmish, Stuart met Lee and Longstreet
and opened the way for them to advance to the
support of Jackson whose forces on the right
wing were engaged in unequal and critical combat.
Later on the same day, Stuart saw that the
Federals were massing in front of Jackson, and
with a small detachment of cavalry aided by
Pelham and his guns, he gallantly held large
forces in check and protected Jackson&rsquo;s
captured wagon train of supplies. On the
afternoon of August 30, the cavalry did most
effectual service, following the retreating
Federals and protecting the exposed Confederate
flank against heavy cavalry attacks. During
the engagements, the Confederate infantry
could not have held its position but for the
assistance of the cavalry under the able direction
of Stuart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>In these battles, Pope had forces largely
superior in number and equipment to Lee&rsquo;s,
but Pope&rsquo;s losses in killed and wounded were
much the heavier. Finally he was forced to
retreat toward Washington, leaving in the
hands of the Confederates many prisoners as
well as captured artillery, arms, and a large
amount of stores. The North seemed panic-stricken,
as Washington was now directly
exposed to the attacks of the Confederates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MARYLAND CAMPAIGN</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1862</span></h2>
<p>General Lee knew, however, that he did not
have men enough to take by assault the strong
fortifications around Washington, and he, therefore,
planned to cross over into Maryland
before the Federal army had recovered from its
defeat, when its commanders were least expecting
him. In order that he might completely mislead
them and make it appear that he was
beginning a general attack on Washington, he
ordered Stuart and his troops to advance
toward that city.</p>
<p>In their advance, they engaged in several
sharp skirmishes with the Federals, finally
driving them from Fairfax Courthouse, where,
amid the cheers of the inhabitants, Major Von
Borcke planted the beloved Confederate flag
on a little common in the center of the village.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The people of this section had been under
Federal control for several months and their
joy at seeing Stuart and his troops was unbounded.
They flocked to the roadside to get a
glimpse of the great cavalry leader.</p>
<p>One lady, who had lost two sons in battle,
came forward as the troops passed her home
and asked permission to kiss the general&rsquo;s

surviving son, a lad of fifteen years, and declared
herself ready if it were needed to give
his life too for her country.</p>
<p>On September 5, General Stuart and his
forces crossed the Potomac. Four days later,
General Lee moved his entire army across the
river, encamped at Frederick, Maryland, and
sent General Jackson to capture the strongly
fortified Federal arsenal at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.</p>
<p>Major Von Borcke, from whose <i>Memoirs of
the Confederate War for Independence</i> we shall
borrow several interesting incidents of this
Maryland campaign, tells us that the crossing of
the cavalry at White&rsquo;s Ford was one of the most
picturesque scenes of the war. The river is
very wide at this point, and its steep banks,
rising to the height of sixty feet, are overshadowed
by large trees that trail from their
branches a perfect network of graceful and luxuriant
vines. A sandy island about midstream
broke the passage of the horsemen and artillery,
and as a column of a thousand troops passed
over, the rays of the setting sun made the
water look like burnished gold. The hearts of
the soldiers crossing the river thrilled at the
sound of the familiar and inspiring strains of
&ldquo;Maryland, my Maryland,&rdquo; which greeted them
from the northern bank.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The enthusiasm of the Maryland people at
Poolesville, where Stuart first stopped, was
boundless. Two young merchants of the village
suddenly resolved to enlist in the cavalry and
they put up all their goods at auction. The
soldiers with the eagerness and carelessness of
children cleared out both establishments in
less than an hour. Many other recruits were
made in this village, all the young men seeming
to feel the inspiration of General Stuart&rsquo;s
favorite song,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;If you want to have a good time</p>
<p class="t0">Jine the cavalry.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>At Urbana, a pretty little village on the road
to Frederick, where General Stuart with one
division of his forces camped for several days,
a most exciting ball was held on the evening
of September 8. There were many charming
families living in the neighborhood, and General
Stuart and his staff decided to give a dance at an
old, unused academy located on a hill just
outside of the town. The young ladies of the
neighborhood willingly lent their help, and
evening found the halls of the academy lighted
by tallow candles and draped with garlands of
roses and with battle flags borrowed from the
regiments of the brigades. Music was furnished
by the band of a Mississippi regiment.
The ball, which had opened to the rousing
strains of &ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; was at its height, when a
young orderly rushed in and to the accompaniment
of distant shots reported that the Federals
had driven in the pickets and were attacking
the camp.</p>
<p>Wild confusion prevailed. The officers got
rapidly to horse and anxious mammas collected
their daughters. Upon reaching the scene of
action, General Stuart found that the danger had
been overestimated and the Federals were
already beginning to retreat. In a short while,
they had been driven back; and by one o&rsquo;clock,
the staff officers had brought the young ladies
back to the academy and the ball had a second
and more auspicious opening. Dancing continued
until dawn, when some soldiers wounded
in the skirmish were brought in, and the ball
room was soon converted into a hospital and the
fair dancers into willing if inexperienced nurses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The next day, General Fitz Lee&rsquo;s brigade was
engaged in a skirmish, and the day following
Colonel Munford, who was commanding Robertson&rsquo;s
Brigade, had a sharp encounter with
Federals at Sugar Loaf Mountain. By Sept. 11,
the Federal cavalry was attacking in such force
that General Stuart saw that it was necessary to
order a retreat toward Frederick. General Fitz
Lee commanded the advance; Colonel Munford
protected the rear, which as it approached
Urbana had a sharp skirmish with the closely-following
Federal cavalry. General Stuart and
his staff, however, did not tear themselves away
from their friends in this hospitable little village
until the Union troops were within half a mile
of the place and several shells had exploded in
the street. From Urbana the cavalry went to
Frederick. Many years after the war was over,
Mrs. Stuart received a letter from a New York
physician, who at the time of the Maryland
campaign had just won his title and a position
on the staff of one of the Union hospitals in
Frederick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>He told about meeting General Stuart and
then said, &ldquo;I wish to bear testimony to the fact
that not only myself, but all the friends of the
Union cause in Frederick, so far as I could learn,
were kindly treated by both officers and private
soldiers. I do not remember of a single instance
where private property was molested, nor was
any taunt, indignity, or insult offered to any
person. Whittier&rsquo;s &lsquo;Barbara Frietchie,&rsquo; which
has attracted so much attention,&mdash;even that is
fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Frederick, Stuart found that General Lee
had already retreated across South Mountain
and taken a position at Sharpsburg on Antietam
Creek, while Jackson was investing Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry. Look at the map on <a class="pgref" href="#Page_95">page 95</a> and you will
see that southwest of Frederick rises a small
spur of the Blue Ridge, called Catoctin Mountain
on the other side of which is a broad, fertile
valley extending for about six miles to the base
of South Mountain. On the opposite side of
South Mountain is Sharpsburg, and across the
same mountain to the south is Harper&rsquo;s Ferry
which Jackson had been ordered to capture
before he marched north to join Lee and Longstreet
at Sharpsburg.</p>
<p>Now you can see that until Harper&rsquo;s Ferry
fell it was necessary that the cavalry should
hinder the advance of the Federal army under
McClellan until Jackson could join Lee. This
was especially difficult, because an order from
General Lee to General D. H. Hill, explaining
fully the commanding general&rsquo;s plans and the
location of all his forces, had fallen into the
hands of General McClellan and he was advancing
a tremendous army toward Sharpsburg
as rapidly as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>As General McClellan&rsquo;s forces advanced,
General Stuart retreated slowly, contesting
every inch of ground. His retreat across
Catoctin Mountain was through Braddock&rsquo;s
Gap, along the same road where eighty-seven
years before, the young patriot, George Washington,
had accompanied General Braddock
on the fatal expedition against Fort Duquesne.
In this gap, Stuart had a sharp encounter with
the Federals. He and Major Von Borcke who
was commanding a gun on the height above the
pass, narrowly escaped being captured by
Federal skirmishers who, under cover of the
dense forest, had worked their way around
behind the gun.</p>
<p>Another sharp encounter took place on
Kittochtan creek at Middletown, half way
across the valley, where General Stuart delayed
the retreat of his forces so long that they barely
escaped capture and reached the foot of South
Mountain just in time to protect the two
principal passes,&mdash;Turner&rsquo;s Gap which led
directly through Boonsboro to Sharpsburg, and
Crampton&rsquo;s Gap which led through Pleasant
Valley to Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>It was necessary to hold these gaps and delay
the enemy until Jackson could capture Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry and unite his division with the remainder
of the army under General Lee. A heavy part of
this work fell on the cavalry and the artillery.
The retreat of Generals Longstreet and Hill,
who had held Turner&rsquo;s Gap until the afternoon
of Sept. 14, was covered by General Fitz
Lee&rsquo;s brigade which held the Federals in check
at every possible point. There was a sharp
encounter at Boonsboro, where, in charging,
General W. H. F. Lee was ridden down by his
own men and narrowly escaped capture.</p>
<p>At Crampton&rsquo;s Gap, which led through
Pleasant Valley to Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, Colonel
Munford gallantly checked the Federal advance
until the evening of Sept. 14, when the troops
sent to assist him broke and retreated in bad
order through Pleasant Valley. General Stuart
had been at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry conferring with
General McLaws; when they heard of the
engagement at Crampton&rsquo;s Gap, both generals
rode quickly forward to meet the routed and
panic-stricken troops which they rallied and
formed into line of battle. The position that
they held the next morning was so strong that
the advancing Federals hesitated to attack;
just as the first shots were being exchanged, the
news of the surrender of Harper&rsquo;s Ferry caused
the attacking party to begin a hasty retreat
along the road that they had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>General Stuart at once reported to General
Jackson, who requested him to convey the news
to General Lee at Sharpsburg. But even now
Lee was in great peril. He had with him, on the
evening of Sept. 14 when the gaps were stormed,
only about 20,000 men; and McClellan&rsquo;s army
of more than 87,000 was advancing rapidly to
attack him. Lee had now either to recross the
Potomac or to fight a battle north of that river.</p>
<p>He decided to make a stand, and on the night
of Sept. 14, drew his army across Antietam
creek and took a strong position on a range of
hills east of the Hagerstown turnpike. Here
he waited for Jackson who, by a forced march,
came up in time to take position on the left
wing on the morning of September 16. Even
when reenforced by Jackson, Lee had a much
smaller force than McClellan.</p>
<p>On the evening of Sept. 16, McClellan attacked
Jackson&rsquo;s wing at the left of Lee&rsquo;s army,
but was repulsed. At early dawn the next day,
the attack was renewed and the combat raged
all day. When night ended the bloody contest,
the Confederates not only held their position,
but had advanced their lines on a part of the
field. During the entire battle, Stuart with
his horse artillery and a small cavalry escort
had guarded the open hilly space between Jackson&rsquo;s
left and the Potomac river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>General Jackson in his report of this battle
said: &ldquo;This officer (General Stuart) rendered
valuable service throughout the day. His
bold use of artillery secured for us an important
position which, had the enemy possessed, might
have commanded our left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, Lee waited for McClellan to
attack, but no movement came from the hostile
camp. Finding out through Stuart&rsquo;s scouts
that large bodies of fresh troops were being sent
to McClellan, Lee withdrew that night to the
south side of the Potomac, and by eleven o&rsquo;clock
the next morning, he was again ready to give
battle should the Federals pursue. He had
brought off nearly everything of value, leaving
behind only several disabled cannon and some
of his wounded.</p>
<p>While Fitz Lee&rsquo;s and Munford&rsquo;s troops were
left to protect the retreat of the army, Stuart
with a small force had gone up the Potomac
to Williamsport, hoping to divert the attention
of the Federals from the main body of the army
and so enable it to cross the river unhindered.
This movement was successful, for large Federal
forces were sent against him, yet he maintained
his position without reenforcements until the
night of September 20, when he recrossed the Potomac
in safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>During this short campaign, several interesting
incidents occurred. On one occasion, when the
Federals were advancing toward Williamsport, a
young lady of the town obtained permission to
fire a cannon that was about to be discharged.
After this, the soldiers always called that
cannon &ldquo;the girl of Williamsport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another time, Major Von Borcke tells us that
he accompanied the general on one of his
favorite, yet dangerous reconnoitering expeditions
outside of the Confederate lines. They
tried to keep themselves concealed by the
dense undergrowth, but they must have been
observed by the pickets, for in a short while
Major Von Borcke heard the &ldquo;little clicking
sound that a saber scabbard often makes in
knocking against a tree,&rdquo; and, looking quickly
around, he saw a long line of Federal cavalry.
A few whispered words to the general were
enough; he and his aide put spurs to their
horses and once more justified their reputations
as expert horsemen, for they were soon hidden
by the friendly trees, while their pursuers were
firing wildly in vain search for the escaped prey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>There were no serious engagements for the
next few weeks and General Lee&rsquo;s army enjoyed
a well deserved rest. The cavalry watched the
movements of the Federals and protected the
camps from alarms. The cavalry headquarters
were delightfully situated near Charlestown on
the plantation of Mr. A. S. Dandridge. Because
of its beautiful grove of huge oak trees, this
plantation was called The Bower. A comfortable
old brick mansion crowned the summit of a
sloping hill on the sides of which the tents of
the camp were located under oak trees. At
the foot of the hill wound the sparkling little
Opequan river. Here provisions were plentiful
once more, and the soldiers enjoyed fishing and
hunting the small game,&mdash;squirrels, rabbits, and
partridges,&mdash;that abounded in the nearby woods.</p>
<p>General Stuart had attached to his staff a
remarkable young banjo player, Bob Sweeny,
who, with the assistance of two fiddlers and
Stuart&rsquo;s mulatto servant Bob who rattled the
bones unusually well, furnished music around
the camp fire for the men and served also on
serenades and at dances given to the officers at
the hospitable Dandridge mansion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>General Stuart was very fond of dancing, and
when some of the young officers of his staff were
occasionally too tired and sleepy to want to join
in the fun, he would have them awakened and
ordered to attend. Yet they complained that
when they did come the general would always
get the prettiest girl for his own partner.</p>
<p>But in spite of his joyous, fun-loving disposition,
General Stuart was always ready when
duty called him. In his book, <i>Christ in the
Camp</i>, the Rev. J. William Jones says, &ldquo;Stuart
was an humble and earnest Christian who
took Christ as his personal Saviour, lived a
stainless life, and died a triumphant death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells us that General Stuart often came
to get his advice in planning services for the
soldiers. Once when General Stuart wanted
Dr. Jones to recommend a chaplain for the cavalry
outposts, the general said, &ldquo;I do not want a
man who is not able to endure hardness as a
good soldier. The man who can not endure the
hardships and privations of our rough riding
and hard service and be in place when needed
would be of no earthly use to us and is not
wanted at my headquarters.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CHAMBERSBURG RAID</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1862</span></h2>
<p>On October 8, after a final dance and serenade
to the ladies at The Bower, Stuart started
out to join the forces that he had ordered to
assemble at Darkesville, from which point he
was to lead them on the famous &ldquo;Chambersburg
Raid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purpose of this raid, which had been
ordered by General Lee, was to march into
Pennsylvania and Maryland and to secure
information concerning the location of McClellan&rsquo;s
army, and also to secure provisions and
horses for the Confederate forces.</p>
<p>Not a soldier of the 1,800 picked cavalrymen
from the brigades of Hampton, Fitz Lee, and
Robertson or the gunners under Pelham, knew
whither they were going or for what purpose.
Most of them, however, had been with Stuart
on his Chickahominy Raid, and all were content
to follow wherever he led.</p>

<p class="caption">MAP SHOWING THE ROUTES OF STUART&rsquo;S CAVALRY IN GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN AND CHAMBERSBURG RAID</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>In his address to his men at the beginning of
the expedition, Stuart said that the enterprise on
which they were about to start demanded coolness,
decision, and bravery, implicit obedience
and the strictest order and sobriety in the camp
and on the bivouac, but that with the hearty
co&ouml;peration of his officers and men he had no
doubt of a success which would reflect credit on
them in the highest degree.</p>
<p>The men in fine spirits reached the Potomac
after dark. The next morning, they crossed the
river at McCoy&rsquo;s Ford, west of McClellan&rsquo;s
army which was posted north of the Potomac
between Shepherdstown and Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. A
heavy fog hung over the river valley and hid
them from the Federal infantry which had just
passed by.</p>
<p>A signal station on Fairview Heights was
taken by twenty men detailed for the purpose
and then the column passed on toward Mercersburg.
By this time, the Federal pickets were
aware of the raid; but as there was no large force
of cavalry at hand, its progress was unchecked.
On and on the little band of horsemen rode
until at nightfall they reached Chambersburg in
Pennsylvania. As Maryland was regarded as a
southern State, nothing belonging to its citizens
had been disturbed; but when Pennsylvania
was reached, soldiers detached from the commands
for that purpose, seized all suitable
horses, giving each owner a receipt, so that he
could call upon the United States government
for payment,&mdash;thus forcing the administration
at Washington either to help equip the Confederate
army or to make its own citizens suffer.
Stuart, with his usual gallantry, gave orders that
the men should not take the horses of ladies
whom they might meet along the highway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>As the command approached Chambersburg
on the night of October 10, a cold drizzling rain
set in. Two pieces of artillery were posted so as
to command the town, and Lieutenant Thomas
Lee with nine men was sent into the town to
demand its surrender. No resistance was made
and the troops were at once marched into the
town and drawn up on the public square.
Strict discipline was observed and only Federal
property was used or destroyed.</p>
<p>During the night, the rain came down in
torrents on the weary, hungry Confederates.
Surrounded by increasing dangers, Stuart with
his staff neither rested nor slept. By that time,
cavalry and infantry were on his track and
every ford of the Potomac was strongly guarded.
At any time, the heavy rains might cause the
river to rise and cut off retreat. His only hope
was to move boldly and swiftly to a crossing
before the water could descend from the mountains
and flood the streams. Stuart decided,
however, not to return the way he had come, as
large forces of Federal cavalry, like hornets,
would be awaiting him there. He resolved to
make another ride around McClellan&rsquo;s army
and to cross at White&rsquo;s Ford some distance to
the east, so close to the Federals that
they would not be looking for him
there. The very boldness of the
plan was its best guarantee of success
and the next morning the general
started his men on their dangerous
march around the enemy.</p>

<p class="caption">STUART&rsquo;S SWORD
<br />From Original in Confederate Museum, Richmond, Va.</p>
</div>
<p>Colonel A. K. McClure of the
Philadelphia <i>Times</i>, then a colonel
in the Federal army and a resident
of Chambersburg, gives the following
account of Stuart as he was
preparing to leave Chambersburg:
&ldquo;General Stuart sat on his horse in
the center of the town, surrounded
by his staff, and his command was
coming in from the country in large
squads, leading their old horses and
riding the new ones which they had
found in the stables hereabout. General Stuart
is of medium stature, has a keen eye, and wore
immense sandy whiskers and mustache. His demeanor
to our people is that of a humane
soldier. In several instances his soldiers began
to take property from stores, but they were
arrested by Stuart&rsquo;s provost guard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>This evidence as to the discipline of Stuart&rsquo;s
men comes from a Federal officer, and shows
fully the control that the general exercised over
his command.</p>
<p>The wounded in the Chambersburg hospital
were paroled, the telegraph wires were cut, and
the ordnance storehouse was blown up by brave
Captain M. C. Butler of South Carolina, who
now commanded
the rear guard. He
notified the people
near the ordnance
storehouse that he
was about to set fire to it and then applied a slow
fuse. There was a loud explosion and then the
flames burst forth. Satisfied that his work was
well done, Colonel Butler and his escort set out
at a trot to rejoin the command.</p>

<p class="caption">STUART&rsquo;s CARBINE
<br />From Original in Confederate Museum, Richmond, Va.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>On the outskirts of the town, there came
galloping up from the rear a young soldier in
gray, riding a big black horse. He wore no hat
and one boot was gone. He was covered with
mud and was soaking wet, for he had come into
town with the rear guard about midnight in
the darkness and pouring rain. The command
had halted for a few hours in a quiet side street
and had set out at break of day as the advance
guard.</p>
<p>The young soldier&rsquo;s foot had been hurt, so he
dismounted and pulled off his boot, in order to
ease the pain. He then concluded to lie down for
awhile and perhaps take a nap, for he was very
tired. Tying the bridle rein to his foot, he lay
down in the pouring rain and went to sleep.
When he awoke, it was broad daylight and he
was all alone. In the darkness of the cloudy
dawn, his comrades had left him sleeping. His
big black horse was still tied to his foot, but his
hat, his haversack, and one of his boots were
gone. Rising quickly, he mounted his horse
and was trying to decide which way to go when
an old lady raised a window near by and called
out, &ldquo;Sonny, your folks have gone that way.&rdquo;
With a lighter heart he thanked her, and set
off at a gallop along the Gettysburg road to
which she had pointed. As he sped along, the
people called out, &ldquo;Go it, Johnny! Goodby,
Johnny! Hurry, Johnny!&rdquo; All seemed to be
in a good humor over the speedy departure of
the Confederates. It was not many minutes
before he reached the rear of Butler&rsquo;s detachment,
and was safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Soon after the break of day, the advance
column under General Fitz Lee started towards
Gettysburg, but at Cashtown the column turned
south toward Emmitsburg in Maryland. When
Stuart arrived at the latter place, the people
received him with great joy and the young
ladies of the town threw flowers at the troops.
But in spite of this hearty welcome, the Confederates
could not linger, for they learned that a
party of Federals in search of them, had passed
only a short time before.</p>
<p>Going in a steady trot without halting, Stuart
passed on to the woods of Frederick, and
captured a courier with a dispatch from the
commander of the party sent out to find him.
From this dispatch, he learned the arrangements
which had been made to capture him, and
learned also that the Federals did not know just
where he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>In the meantime, the Federal cavalry was
hurrying to overtake him, but Stuart, aware of
his extreme danger, aimed straight for the
Potomac. His tired men and horses marched all
night, and by dawn on October 13, they reached
Hyattstown where a few wagons were captured.
On the march, Stuart had learned that a division
of five thousand men was guarding the fords in
front of him. Knowing that delay would increase
his peril, he hastened on in the direction
of Poolesville where a body of Federal cavalry
was located.</p>
<p>When within two miles of that town, guided
by Captain White who was familiar with the
region, he turned abruptly through some woods
which concealed his movements and gained the
road leading to the river about two miles distant.
Hardly had the Confederates entered this
road when the advance squadron met the head
of the Federal column coming from Poolesville.
General Stuart, who was at the head of the
squadron, ordered a charge and drove the Federals
back upon the main body half a mile away.
Thinking that Stuart was aiming to cross the
strongly-guarded ford at the mouth of the
Monocacy river, the Federals, instead of seizing
this favorable opportunity to make an advance
and crush the Confederate cavalry, waited for
their infantry to come up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>In the meanwhile, General Fitz Lee&rsquo;s sharpshooters
leaped from their horses and went
forward while one of Pelham&rsquo;s guns was brought
up. Under cover of its fire and screened from
view by the ridge upon which it was placed,
General Lee&rsquo;s command moved on by a farm
road to White&rsquo;s Ford.</p>
<p>When General Lee reached White&rsquo;s Ford, he
found a force of two hundred Federal infantry
so strongly posted on the steep bank overlooking
the ford that a crossing seemed impossible.
Infantry in front and cavalry in the
rear! Would it be possible to escape from the
snare by which they were surrounded? Nothing
but boldness and swiftness could save them.
General Lee sent a courier to General Stuart
who was on the Poolesville road with Pelham&rsquo;s
guns and the skirmishers keeping back Federal
troopers until the rear guard should come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe that the ford can be crossed,&rdquo;
said General Lee.</p>
<p>Stuart replied, &ldquo;I am occupied in the rear, but
the ford must be crossed at all hazards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Lee, therefore, prepared to attack the
Federal infantry in its strong position on the
bluff. One part of his force was to assail it in
front and on the left flank, while a strong body
of cavalry endeavored to cross and hold the
ford. Lee hoped to be able to get one gun placed
on the opposite bank and then to fire on the
Federal rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>While making his hurried preparations, it
occurred to General Lee to try a game of &ldquo;bluff.&rdquo;
Under flag of truce, he sent a note to the Federal
commander, saying that General Stuart&rsquo;s whole
command was in his front and needless bloodshed
would be avoided if he would surrender.
Fifteen minutes was allowed him to consider
this demand.</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes&rsquo; anxious waiting and no
reply, General Fitz Lee opened with his artillery
and was preparing to advance his horsemen,
when it was seen that the Federals, with flags
flying and band playing, were retreating in
perfect order down the river.</p>
<p>A wild cheer broke from the Confederates
as some of their men rushed across the ford to
place a piece of artillery at the top of the steep
bank on the Virginia side of the Potomac.
Another gun was hurried forward and placed so
as to sweep the tow-path and the approaches
to the ford, While the long line of cavalrymen
and captured horses passed rapidly across to
safety. Once more Stuart had slipped through
the hands of his enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In the meanwhile, Pelham held the Federals
in check until all but the rear guard under
Colonel Butler had passed. Then he began to
withdraw, making his last stand on the Maryland
side of the ford, where he fired up and down the
river at the Federal cavalry now advancing in
both directions. But the rear guard was still far
behind. Major McClellan tells us that General
Stuart had sent back four couriers to hurry
up Colonel Butler; still he did not come. In
this dilemma, Captain Blackford volunteered
to find him.</p>
<p>Stuart paused a moment and then extending
his hand said, &ldquo;All right! and if we do not meet
again, good-by, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackford galloped off and found Butler with
his own regiment and the North Carolina
detachment and one gun, engaged in delaying
the advance of the enemy in the Poolesville
road. Blackford rode rapidly toward him and
shouted, &ldquo;General Stuart says, &lsquo;Withdraw at a
gallop, or you will be cut off.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied Butler, with great coolness,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can bring off that gun. The
horses can&rsquo;t move it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the gun and save your men!&rdquo; replied
Blackford.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see what can be done,&rdquo; said
Butler, and then he ordered the drivers to
make one more effort. That time they were
successful. The weary horses pulled the wheels
out of the mudhole and the gun went rattling
down the road, followed by the tardy but
gallant rear guard. The Federal cavalry and
artillery were following and infantry was approaching
in two directions; but the rear guard
slipped through the net, dashed rapidly across
the ford, and soon was safe in Virginia.</p>
<p>The joy of the men and their commander at
the success of their expedition was unbounded.
The Federals were near enough to hear the
Confederate cheers that greeted General Stuart
as he rode along his lines on the Virginia side.</p>
<p>In the official report of the expedition, Stuart
claimed no personal credit, but closed the
report by saying, &ldquo;Believing that the hand of
God was clearly manifested in the deliverance
of my command from danger and the crowning
success attending it, I ascribe to him the praise,
the honor, and the glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The march of the Confederate cavalry from
Chambersburg is one of the most remarkable
in history. In thirty-six hours, the Confederates
rode ninety miles, going completely around
the Union army. They carried off hundreds of
horses, and recrossed the Potomac in the presence
of vastly superior forces of the Federals.
Only one man was wounded and two stragglers
were captured.</p>

<p>General Stuart himself, however, suffered a
heavy personal loss, for his servant Bob who
rattled the bones so well, got separated from the
column, with two of the general&rsquo;s favorite
horses, Skylark and Lady Margaret. He
wrote his wife that he hoped that they had
fallen into the hands of the good secessionists at
Emmitsburg, for he could not bear to think of
the Federals having his favorite horses.</p>
<p>The horses of the Federal cavalry had been so
worn out in pursuit of the wily Stuart that
remounts were necessary before the cavalry
could again advance into Virginia. The whole
North was astonished and indignant that Stuart
had again ridden completely around the Union
army and had again made his escape.</p>
<p>To the South, Stuart was a peerless hero and
he was welcomed with great acclamation. A
lady of Baltimore, as a token of her appreciation
of his gallantry, sent him a pair of gold
spurs. He was very proud of these and in his
intimate letters after this, he sometimes signed
himself, &ldquo;K. G. S.&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Knight of the Golden
Spurs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brief space of two days was all the time
given to the men and horses of Stuart&rsquo;s command
to rest and enjoy life at The Bower,
before they were again called out to active
service. General McClellan had sent two large
forces of infantry and cavalry across the river
to find out whether General Lee&rsquo;s army was
still in the Valley or whether it had moved east
of the Blue Ridge mountains. After several
skirmishes with Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry, these troops
retired, convinced that Lee was still in the
Valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>On October 26, McClellan crossed the
Potomac and the weather continuing fine, he
advanced his entire army to begin an autumn
campaign against Lee. A week later, his forces
began to advance toward Washington, a little
village northwest of Culpeper and near the
headwaters of the Rappahannock. This position
was desirable because it would give an easy
route toward Richmond. General Lee, however,
sent Longstreet at once with some of the
cavalry to head
off the Federals at
Culpeper, while
Jackson was to remain
in the Valley
and threaten their
rear.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic24">

<p class="caption">MAJOR JOHN PELHAM</p>
</div>
<p>In the meantime,
Stuart bade
a final farewell to
his pleasant camp
quarters and his
friends at the Dandridge
mansion.
His force fell slowly
back toward Culpeper,
contesting
every inch of
ground against the overwhelming numbers
of the Federal cavalry. Sharp encounters took
place at Union, Middleburg, and Upperville,
in which the artillery under Pelham did wonderfully
daring and effective work. In these encounters,
the Federals lost nearly twice as many
men as did the Confederates, but it was impossible
for Stuart&rsquo;s small forces to hold any
permanent ground against the greatly superior
numbers now marching against him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>At Ashby&rsquo;s Gap, General Stuart came near
being cut off from his own forces. He had
commanded Colonel Rosser to hold this gap
while he, accompanied by a few members of his
staff, rode across the mountain for a conference
with General Jackson. When Stuart returned
the next day, after a hard ride over a little-used
mountain trail, what was his surprise on reaching
a point just above what had been his own
camp, to find the place literally swarming with
blue-coats.</p>
<p>Rosser had found it necessary to withdraw
before the superior numbers of the Federals and
his couriers who went to inform Stuart of this
fact had missed the general who had returned
by a short cut across the mountain. He and
his men were indeed in a serious predicament,
and had they not found a mountaineer, who
knew the trails on the other side of the mountain,
there is no telling when or where General
Stuart would have joined his command. He
was guided safely to Barber&rsquo;s Cross Roads where
his forces had retreated and he made the simple
and faithful mountaineer happy with a fifty-dollar
note.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>On November 10, there was an engagement
at Barber&rsquo;s Cross Roads, and the Confederate
cavalry was forced to retreat through Orleans
and across the Rappahannock at Waterloo
Bridge. That night Stuart received the news
of the death of his dear little daughter, Flora.
For some time he had known of her serious
illness, and the doctor had written that he must
come home if he wished to see her, but he knew
that his country needed him to hold the Federal
cavalry in check.</p>
<p>When the second urgent call reached him on
the field of battle near Union, he wrote Mrs.
Stuart: &ldquo;I was at no loss to decide that it was
my duty to you and to Flora to remain here.
I am entrusted with the conduct of affairs, the
issue of which will affect you, her, and the
mothers and children of our whole country much
more seriously than we can believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my darling&rsquo;s case is hopeless, there are ten
chances to one that I will get to Lynchburg too
late; if she is convalescent, why should my
presence be necessary? She was sick nine days
before I knew it. Let us trust in the good God
who has blessed us so much, that He will spare
our child to us, but if it should please Him to
take her from us, let us bear it with Christian
fortitude and resignation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Major Von Borcke, who opened the telegram
telling of the child&rsquo;s death, says that when the
general read it he was completely overcome, but
that he bore his loss most bravely, especially
when Mrs. Stuart came to visit him a few days
later at Culpeper.</p>
<p>He never forgot his &ldquo;little darling&rdquo; and often
talked of her to Von Borcke, who says very
prettily: &ldquo;Light blue flowers recalled her eyes to
him; in the glancing sunbeams he caught the
golden tinge of her hair, and whenever he saw
a child with such eyes and hair he could not
help tenderly embracing it. He thought of her
on his deathbed, and drawing me to him he
whispered, &lsquo;My dear friend, I shall soon be with
my little Flora again.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet such a father could put aside his own
feelings when he felt that his country needed
him. Duty to God and his country were his
watchwords, and this high and unselfish sense of
duty and patriotism was the foundation of his
greatness both as a man and a soldier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The cavalry fell back from Waterloo Bridge to
join Longstreet at Culpeper, but every day it
was engaged in sharp skirmishes with the
Federal cavalry. In one of these engagements,
General Stuart had an amusing experience that
narrowly escaped being a serious one. Major
Von Borcke tells us that while his cavalry was
being forced back under a very heavy fire,
Stuart in endeavoring to make it hold its
position, uselessly but according to his custom,
exposed his own person on horseback by riding
out of the wood into an open field where he and
his aide were excellent targets for their enemies.
Von Borcke remonstrated, but the general, who
could not bear to have the day go against him,
curtly said to his young aide, &ldquo;If it is too hot
for you, you can retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, Von Borcke remained in his position
at the general&rsquo;s side, but he did shelter himself
from the rain of bullets, behind a convenient
tree. From this position, a few moments later
he saw Stuart raise his hand quickly to his
beloved mustache, one half of which had been
neatly cut away by a whistling bullet.</p>
<p>As a result of their heavy and continuous
marching, the horses of Stuart&rsquo;s troops were in
bad condition, many of them having sore
tongues and a disease known as &ldquo;grease heel&rdquo;;
in spite of this and the absence of many men
who had gone home to procure fresh horses,
the services now rendered by the cavalry were
invaluable. General Lee said in his report of
this campaign that the vigilance, activity, and
courage of the cavalry were conspicuous, and to
its assistance was due in a great measure the
success of some of the army&rsquo;s most important
operations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>While General Lee was awaiting the movements
of the Federal army, an event happened
which changed the entire aspect of military
affairs. General McClellan was removed from
command and General Burnside was put in his
place. General McClellan had been too slow
and cautious to suit the authorities at Washington;
so, much to the delight of the Confederate
government, this able general was removed just
as his campaign had begun.</p>
<p>General Burnside remained at Warrenton ten
days in order to reorganize his army into three
divisions. Then he began to move his forces
toward Fredericksburg on the Rappahannock
river. This movement was at once observed
by Stuart and reported to General Lee who
immediately began to move troops toward
Fredericksburg. When Burnside&rsquo;s forces reached
the northern bank of the river, they found the
town in Lee&rsquo;s possession and the heights to the
south of it crowned by his artillery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>General Lee now ordered General Jackson
to come from the Valley to join him. While
waiting for this reenforcement, he began to construct
earthworks for his artillery and to dig
rifle-pits for his infantry on the range of hills
extending in a semicircle for five miles south of
the river. Here with Hampton guarding the left
wing of the army and Stuart the right, the Confederates
camped in comparative quiet until
early in December.</p>
<p>During this period, there were several heavy
snowstorms which the soldiers enjoyed like so
many schoolboys. Major Von Borcke tells of a
snow battle when several hundred men of
McLaws&rsquo; division charged across a snow-covered
plain half a mile wide, on the quarters of Hood&rsquo;s
division. Suddenly Hood&rsquo;s whole division, led
by its officers with colors flying, advanced
against the attacking party which was driven
back some distance. Then receiving reenforcements
from their own division, the men rallied
and threw up entrenchments behind which they
made a stand. The air was white with flying
snowballs, and the contest waxed hottest just at
Stuart&rsquo;s headquarters where he stood on a box
and cheered the contestants. Hood&rsquo;s men finally
drove their opponents from the snow entrenchments,
and would have routed them utterly,
had not Anderson&rsquo;s division come up to assist
their fleeing comrades. With these reenforcements,
McLaws&rsquo; men suddenly turned and drove
Hood&rsquo;s division back home. From these sham
battles, the army turned soon to real warfare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>General Burnside had posted guns on Stafford
Heights opposite Fredericksburg and on
December 10, he shelled the town. Then his
splendid army of 116,000 men crossed the river
on pontoon bridges, and on the morning of December
13, it stormed Lee&rsquo;s position. The battle
raged all day, but the Federals were repulsed at
all points and when night closed, the Confederates
were still holding their position.</p>
<p>This battle of Fredericksburg offered little
opportunity for cavalry charges, but General
Fitz Lee kept watch over the fords on the Confederate
left, while General W. H. F. Lee was
posted on the right. Stuart also remained on
the right as it was the weakest part of the line,
and was in constant conference with Lee and
Jackson.</p>
<p>As the Federals made their first advance
against the troops of Jackson at Hamilton&rsquo;s
Crossing near the extreme right, Major Pelham
of the Stuart Horse Artillery in an exposed
position opened a cross fire with one gun and
caused them to halt for over an hour. Five
Federal batteries opened upon him, but he continued
to fire until withdrawn by Stuart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Both General Lee and General Jackson were
on the extreme right and witnessed the wonderful
work done by Major Pelham&rsquo;s gun. Both
of them in their reports of this battle mentioned
the genius and bravery of the young Alabamian.</p>
<p>General Jackson asked General Stuart, &ldquo;Have
you another Pelham, general? If so, I wish that
you would give him to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Lee expected the battle to be renewed
the next morning, but Burnside remained
quiet, and, on the night of December 15, in a
violent storm of wind and rain, he withdrew to
the opposite bank.</p>
<p>It soon became evident that Burnside had no
intention of renewing the combat, but was preparing
to pass the winter on the Stafford hills
on the northern side of the river. General
Lee&rsquo;s army, therefore, went into winter quarters
along the south bank of the Rappahannock.
The infantry and artillery built snug log huts,
and began, in spite of the want of good rations
and warm clothes, to enjoy the rest from
marching and fighting.</p>
<p>The cavalry, however, had no rest, for upon
its vigilance depended the safety of the army.
It observed the Federal movements, watched
the fords of the river, and made continual raids
to the rear of Burnside&rsquo;s army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>On December 20, General Stuart set out
with 1,800 men under the command of his
tried and true generals, Hampton, Fitz Lee,
and W. H. F. Lee, on what is known as the
&ldquo;Dumfries Raid.&rdquo; They were to pass by different
routes to the rear of Burnside&rsquo;s army, to
cut his line of communication with Washington
city, and to destroy all wagons and stores that
they could not bring off.</p>

<br />CONFEDERATES DESTROYING RAILROAD</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Stuart led his forces between various army-posts
that guarded the rear of Burnside&rsquo;s army,
avoiding the strongest and attacking others
which he knew to be weak or ignorant of his
approach. He at last marched north to Burke&rsquo;s
Station, where his keen sense of humor caused
him to play a joke on the authorities at Washington.</p>
<p>He surprised the telegraph operator at the
instrument, just as he was receiving a message
from headquarters at the capital, telling of
measures which were being taken to capture
Stuart&rsquo;s command. Having thus gained important
information, Stuart put one of his own
men in the operator&rsquo;s place and sent a message
to Meigs, the quartermaster general at Washington.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am much satisfied with the transport of mules lately
sent, which I have taken possession of, and request that
you send me a fresh supply.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">J. E. B. Stuart.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This message produced great consternation in
Washington, where the people were as afraid of
Stuart and his cavalry as they were of the whole
Confederate army.</p>
<p>After thus revealing his whereabouts, Stuart
marched quickly back to Culpeper Courthouse,
which he reached on December 30, having
lost on the raid, one killed, thirteen wounded,
and fourteen missing. About twenty wagons
and some stores had been captured. This was
the fourth raid that Stuart had made around or
to the rear of the Federals, without capture or
serious loss.</p>

<br />FEDERALS REPAIRING RAILROAD WHICH CONFEDERATES HAD DESTROYED</p>
</div>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Dabney in his <i>Life of Stonewall
Jackson</i> tells us that during this winter, General
Jackson had for his headquarters a hunting
lodge near Moss Neck. Here he was often
visited by General Stuart on his rounds of
official duty. These visits were always welcome
to Jackson who admired and loved the young
cavalry leader and they were the signal of fun
for the young men of the staff. While Stuart
poured out &ldquo;quips and cranks,&rdquo; often at Jackson&rsquo;s
expense, the latter sat by, silent and
blushing, but enjoying the jests with a quiet
laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>The walls of the lodge were ornamented with
pictures which gave Stuart many a topic for
jokes. Pretending to believe that they had
been selected by Jackson himself, he would point
now to the portrait of a famous race horse and
now to the print of a dog noted for his hunting
feats, and remark that they showed queer taste
for a devout Presbyterian. Once Jackson, with
a smile, replied that perhaps in his youth he had
been fonder of race horses than his friends suspected.</p>
<p>One day, in the midst of a gay conversation,
dinner was announced and the two generals
with their aides passed to the mess table.
The center of the table was graced by a print of
butter upon which was impressed the image of a
rooster. It had been presented to Jackson by a
lady of the neighborhood and had been placed
upon the table in honor of Stuart.</p>
<p>As the eyes of the gay young general fell upon
it, they sparkled with glee and he exclaimed,
&ldquo;See there, gentlemen! We have the crowning
evidence of our host&rsquo;s sporting tastes. He even
puts his favorite gamecock upon his butter!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The dinner, of course, began with merry
laughter in which General Jackson joined with
much zest.</p>
<p>In patriotism, in bravery, and in military skill,
says Dr. Dabney, these two men were kindred
spirits, but Stuart&rsquo;s cheerfulness and humor
were the opposites of Jackson&rsquo;s serious and
diffident temper.</p>
<p>Though bitter cold weather had now set in,
General Burnside resolved to make an effort to
turn the right of General Lee&rsquo;s army and drive
him from his winter quarters at Fredericksburg.
This attempt, however, was unsuccessful, and
General Burnside&rsquo;s failure at Fredericksburg
caused him to be replaced by General Joseph
Hooker, called &ldquo;Fighting Joe Hooker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hooker reorganized the army into corps; and
made one corps of the cavalry, with tried and
skillful officers. He also provided the cavalry
with the best horses and equipments that money
could procure. He realized that the Federal
cavalry had never been fit to contend successfully
with Stuart and the forces under his command,
and so now did all in his power to
strengthen this branch of the Federal service.
By the early spring, Hooker had his army completely
reorganized and ready to begin a campaign
against General Lee.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line3">1863</span></h2>
<p>In the meanwhile, General Lee&rsquo;s soldiers
across the Rappahannock river suffered greatly
for want of proper food and clothing during the
long cold winter. The appeals of their beloved
commander to the Confederate government
were not heeded; but the soldiers endured their
privations with great fortitude and when
spring arrived, they were ready for the coming
great battle with the army of &ldquo;Fighting Joe
Hooker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On March 17, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, there was
a cavalry engagement at Kelly&rsquo;s Ford, near
Culpeper, where General Fitz Lee won a remarkable
victory over a large force of Federal
cavalry under Brigadier-General Averell. Lee,
who was stationed at Culpeper, had only
about 800 men to meet more than 2,000
Federals, but he disposed his forces with such
skill and fought so stubbornly that Averell,
in spite of the fact that he had a large force in
reserve, was unable to break Lee&rsquo;s thin lines
and retreated across the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>General Stuart happened to be at Culpeper,
attending a court martial, when this engagement
occurred. He saw how skillfully Lee was
handling the situation and unselfishly refused to
assume command, wishing his able brigadier
general to win all the glory of repulsing such a
large force.</p>
<p>In this battle, John Pelham, Stuart&rsquo;s young
chief of artillery of whom we have so often
spoken, was killed. He had accompanied Stuart
to Culpeper, merely on a visit of pleasure, but
when he heard the call of Confederate artillery,
even though it was not his own guns, he immediately
went forward to take part in the
engagement. Borrowing a horse from Bob
Sweeny, he hurried to the battle ground. He
rushed into the thickest of the fray, to rally a
regiment that was beginning to waver.</p>
<p>Just as he shouted, &ldquo;Forward, boys! forward
to victory and glory!&rdquo; he was mortally wounded
by a fragment of a shell.</p>
<p>The whole South mourned the death of this
young hero. James R. Randall, the author of
&ldquo;Maryland, My Maryland,&rdquo; said of him:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Gentlest and bravest in the battle brunt,</p>
<p class="t">The Champion of the Truth,</p>
<p class="t0">He bore the banner to the very front</p>
<p class="t">Of our immortal youth.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>His body was carried to Richmond and lay in
state in the Capitol, until it could be borne under
proper military escort to his native state,
Alabama. Stuart, who loved Pelham like a son,
went to Richmond to be present at the funeral.</p>
<p>When he wrote Mrs. Stuart of the young
hero&rsquo;s death, he said, &ldquo;His record is complete and
it is spotless and noble. His character pure and
his disposition as sweet and innocent as our
child.&rdquo; The general had a strong personal
affection for the young men of his staff and the
death of Pelham was as great a grief to Stuart
as it was a loss to the army.</p>
<p>Stuart&rsquo;s men and horses were greatly
weakened by the heavy and almost constant
skirmishes, picket duty, and raids in which they
had been engaged since the fall. On the other
hand, the Federal cavalry, just reorganized into
one splendid corps under the command of
Major-General George Stoneman, was in better
condition than ever before. General Hooker
depended upon this large and finely-equipped
force to open a campaign which would prove
fatal to General Lee&rsquo;s army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>General Stoneman was ordered to cross the
Rappahannock river at one of the fords in
Culpeper county and, after dispersing the small
force of Confederate cavalry in that vicinity,
to proceed toward Richmond, destroying the
Central Railroad, capturing all supply stations,
and doing all possible damage along the Pamunkey
river. He was then to proceed to the
Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad, and by
breaking up that road and burning certain
bridges, to cut General Lee&rsquo;s army off from
Richmond. As soon as Stoneman started on his
raid, the &ldquo;Grand Army,&rdquo; as it was called, under
General Hooker himself, was to move to
Chancellorsville about ten miles southwest of
Fredericksburg. Thus General Lee was to be
forced to come out of his entrenched position
and to give battle on ground of Hooker&rsquo;s own
choosing.</p>
<p>Several bodies of Federal cavalry tried to
cross at various fords on the Rappahannock and
Rapidan rivers, but were repulsed by small
bodies of watchful Confederate pickets. The
rivers were now rising rapidly from the usual
spring rains, and the Rappahannock became so
swollen that the advance of Stoneman was
checked for two weeks. Many of Stuart&rsquo;s
troopers were absent for various reasons and
he had only about two thousand men with
whom to guard the fords and to cover a front
of more than fifty miles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>On the afternoon of April 24, three corps of
Federal infantry appeared at Kelly&rsquo;s Ford. A
strong party crossed in boats and drove the
pickets from the ford. They then laid a pontoon
bridge; and during the night, the Twelfth Army
Corps passed to the southern shore. The next
morning, Stuart learned that the entire Grand
Army was on the move. He telegraphed this
information to General Lee who ordered Stuart
at once to swing around the Federal divisions
that had crossed the river and join him at
Fredericksburg. General W. H. F. Lee with
only two regiments&mdash;a small force but all that
could be spared&mdash;was sent to protect the
Central Railroad from Stoneman&rsquo;s cavalry.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Stuart, skirmishing day and night with the
Federal cavalry, marched rapidly to the help of
Lee. As the cavalry passed at night through
the dark forest lighted only by the faint rays of a
crescent moon, they had frequent alarms and
several encounters with small forces of the
Federal cavalry already posted in the woods.</p>
<p>At one time, Stuart, accompanied by only a
few officers of his staff, was riding some distance
ahead of his brigade, and met such a large
Federal force that he was compelled to take flight.
Later, when riding at the head of a regiment
that he had called up as an advance guard,
he suddenly encountered several regiments of
hostile cavalry drawn up across a field in line of
battle. Stuart&rsquo;s small force became panic-stricken.
All efforts of the general to rally his
men were in vain and he was compelled a second
time to retreat hastily. It seemed for a time
that he would be cut off from his forces, but
Colonel Munford came up with his regiment,
charged gallantly, captured most of the attacking
Federals, and left the road again open.
Several such skirmishes occurred and the troops
were rendered almost panic-stricken by these
unlooked-for attacks. In the darkness, they
often fired on each other instead of on their foe,
and they feared an ambush at each turn of the
road. Altogether, it was a march of doubt and
danger, but they finally reached Lee&rsquo;s army
without serious loss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Chancellorsville, to which place the main
army of General Hooker was being moved, was
not a town, but merely a large farmhouse surrounded
by the usual outbuildings. Toward
Fredericksburg ten miles distant, the country
was somewhat open; but in every other direction
it was covered with tall pines and with
dense thickets of scrub oaks and many other
kinds of trees and flowering plants. This forest,
called &ldquo;the Wilderness,&rdquo; was about twenty
miles long and fifteen broad. It was traversed
by two good roads, the Plank road and the old
Turnpike; it was along these roads, the possession
of which would, of course, be hotly contested
by the Federal troops, that General Lee
would have to send his forces to attack General
Hooker in his strong position at Chancellorsville.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>But on the night of the first of May, just after
the first skirmishing had occurred along these
two roads, Stuart brought information that
changed the situation decidedly. He rode up
about eleven o&rsquo;clock to an old fallen tree where
Lee and Jackson were talking over the plans
for the next day, and reported that while
Hooker had fortified his position at Chancellorsville
on the east, the south, and the southwest,
upon the north and the west he had no defences.
At the same time, information had been secured
concerning an old road by which a circuit could
be made around Hooker&rsquo;s army. Jackson at
once conceived the idea of making a forced
march by this road so as to attack Hooker in the
rear on the next day. Lee agreed, as on this
plan seemed to depend their one chance of
success.</p>
<p>The next morning, General Lee with about
14,000 men remained in front of the Federals on
the Plank and Turnpike roads, while Jackson
with three divisions marched fifteen miles
through the forest and about three o&rsquo;clock in
the afternoon reached the rear of Hooker&rsquo;s army
on the west. General Fitz Lee with the First
Virginia cavalry led the advance while the
other regiments of cavalry protected the right
of Jackson&rsquo;s line of march. Colonel Munford,
commander of one of these regiments, was
familiar with this part of the country and
rendered valuable service as a guide to Jackson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>As Jackson&rsquo;s command marched first directly
south by the Furnace road, Federal scouts, who
were spying from the tops of tall pine trees,
thought that Lee&rsquo;s army was in full retreat.
They carried this report to Hooker who sent
forward two divisions to attack the marching
column. By that time, Jackson had turned
to the west and, completely screened by trees
and undergrowth, was marching rapidly along
the old road. The rear of his column, however,
was attacked near Catherine Furnace. This
attack was soon checked by McLaws, whom
Lee sent forward from his small force, and by
two regiments sent back by Jackson when he
heard the firing in his rear.</p>
<p>While the infantry was swinging along the
forest road, the cavalry had reached the Plank
road, near Chancellorsville, and was awaiting
General Jackson. Fitz Lee, impatient at
the delay, rode toward the Federal line, and
found to his surprise that it was near at hand
and in full view from his post of observation.
The Federals did not dream that the Confederates
could reach the road at this point and so had
no guards stationed there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Afterwards Fitz Lee thus described the scene:
&ldquo;Below and but a few hundred yards distant,
ran the Federal line of battle. There was the
line of defense and long lines of stacked arms in
the rear. Two cannons were visible in the part
of the line seen. The soldiers were in groups in
the rear, laughing, chatting, smoking; probably
engaged, here and there, in a game of cards and
other amusements indulged in when feeling safe
and awaiting orders. In the rear were other
persons driving up and butchering beeves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing the importance of his discovery,
Lee rode back to meet Jackson and guided him to
the same place of observation. Jackson immediately
placed his troops in position on the
turnpike and ordered them to advance and
attack the unsuspecting enemy. As long as the
dense growth and rough ground permitted,
Stuart and his cavalry guarded the left flank.
After a rapid march through the tangled
thickets, the men rushed forward with wild
cheers and dashed upon the unsuspecting
Federals as they were cooking their suppers.
The panic-stricken Federal soldiers rushed back
upon their center, and as the terror spread,
after them went horses, wagons, cannon, men&mdash;speeding
to recross the Rappahannock. The
officers tried in vain to stop the fleeing men.
For a while, the panic was so great that the destruction
of Hooker&rsquo;s army seemed certain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>After pursuing the Federals for two hours until
they were within half a mile of Hooker&rsquo;s headquarters
at the Chancellor house, the Confederates
stopped in the darkness to reform.
Just at this critical moment, General Hooker
succeeded in bringing up reenforcements and
posted fresh artillery in the edge of the woods on
Hazel Grove, a small hill in front of General
Jackson&rsquo;s assaulting column. Still, however,
the soldiers in gray advanced. General A. P.
Hill&rsquo;s division was now ordered to the front to
take charge of the pursuit. While he was engaged
in forming his lines, General Jackson with
several aides and couriers rode down the Plank
road nearly to the defenses around Chancellorsville.
As they were returning, they were fired
upon by some of their own men who had been
posted in the thickets and who, in the moonlight,
mistook Jackson and his escort for Federal
cavalry.</p>
<p>General Jackson was wounded and was borne
from the field. A little later, General Hill also
was wounded. Jackson then sent for Stuart
who had been ordered to hold the road to Ely&rsquo;s
Ford, one of the Federal lines of retreat.</p>
<p>As soon as Stuart received the sad news that
Jackson had been wounded, he placed Fitz Lee
in command of the force holding the road and
hastened into the heart of the Wilderness. It
was midnight when he arrived at the front and
according to Jackson&rsquo;s orders assumed command
of the victorious but wearied corps.</p>

<p class="caption">GENERAL STONEWALL JACKSON
<br />From an original negative by Cooke, the last photograph made of General Jackson</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Stuart, not knowing Jackson&rsquo;s plans for
completing the movement, sent an aide to
Jackson to request instructions.</p>
<p>General Jackson replied, &ldquo;Tell General Stuart
to act upon his own judgment and do what he
thinks best. I have implicit trust in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a message from his loved chieftain must
have meant much to the young general who
found himself suddenly confronted with such a
serious situation, and the next day he proved
that Jackson had not trusted him in vain.</p>
<p>First of all, it was necessary that Stuart, who
had been absent from the front sometime, should
have a clear idea of the position of his men and
of the Federals. He, therefore, at once called a
meeting of the infantry commanders. As a
result of this consultation, it was decided to
defer until the next morning the attack upon the
strong fortifications around Chancellorsville.
The rest of the night was spent by the officers
in preparations for the coming assault; the men
lay upon their arms and took a brief rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>When morning dawned, the guns of Lee, who
was working his way along the two main roads
to join Jackson, thundered on the east and the
south, and those of Stuart answered on the west.
In both wings of Lee&rsquo;s army, the battle raged
furiously. After many assaults, Hazel Grove
where the Federal artillery and infantry were
posted in force, was taken by Stuart. Then
arose a mighty struggle for the clearing around
the Chancellor house. Stuart ordered thirty
pieces of artillery to be posted so as to sweep
the clearing with canister and grapeshot. Under
this fire, his own men advanced, Stuart himself
leading two of the charges. One of his officers
said that he &ldquo;looked like a very god of battle.&rdquo;
As he rode forward at the head of his forces, he
sang at the top of his clear voice which could be
heard above the din of battle,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Old Joe Hooker,</p>
<p class="t0">Won&rsquo;t you come out of the wilderness?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At the third assault, the works were carried
and connection was made with General Lee&rsquo;s
force. By ten o&rsquo;clock, the Chancellor house and
the woods around it, full of wounded men, were
on fire from the bursting shells. The Confederate
flag floated proudly in the clearing
around the house and the Confederate army
was again united, while Hooker&rsquo;s forces in full
retreat were swept back into the woods north of
Chancellorsville.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>A great southern historian and military critic,
General Alexander, says &ldquo;the promptness and
boldness with which Stuart assumed command,
and led the ranks of Jackson, thinned by their
hard day&rsquo;s march and fighting to not more than
20,000 men, against Hooker&rsquo;s 80,000 soldiers
was one of the most brilliant deeds of the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the battle of Chancellorsville was in
progress, Stoneman, the Federal cavalry leader,
had crossed the Rappahannock and was marching
toward Richmond. General W. H. F. Lee followed
him with two regiments and so hindered
his line of march that the Federal general, in
spite of his excellent cavalry, was forced to retire
with few spoils and little glory. Stoneman
was soon after relieved of his command, and
Pleasanton was put in his place as major general
of the Federal cavalry.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BATTLE OF BRANDY STATION</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1863</span></h2>
<p>Soon after the battle of Chancellorsville,
Lee&rsquo;s army was reenforced by the return of
Longstreet&rsquo;s corps, which had been for some
time at Suffolk, Va., and the cavalry was increased
by the addition of new regiments from
North Carolina and the Shenandoah Valley.
Lee&rsquo;s total forces were now about 80,000 and
his men, encouraged by their recent victory,
were in good fighting trim. Lee decided to carry
the scene of war once more into northern territory.
He hoped to form a line of battle near
the Susquehanna river in the fertile fields of
Pennsylvania, where he could force the Federals
to fight on ground of his own choosing. The
next weeks were spent in preparation for this
northward movement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>On June 6, there was a cavalry review on the
open plain between Culpeper Courthouse and
Brandy Station. Great preparations had been
made for this review. Each trooper had burnished
his weapons and trappings and rubbed down
his much-enduring charger, in order that they
might make the best appearance possible.
Visitors, especially many ladies, from all the
country round attended the magnificent spectacle.</p>
<p>Stuart and his entire staff took their position
on a little grassy knoll. Eight thousand troopers
and sixteen pieces of horse artillery passed before
him in columns of squadrons,&mdash;first at a walk,
then at a gallop&mdash;while the guns of a battery on
a hill opposite the reviewing stand fired at
regular intervals.</p>
<p>An eyewitness of the scene tells us that Stuart
&ldquo;was superbly mounted. The trappings on his
proud, prancing horse all looked bright and new
and his sidearms gleamed in the morning sun
like burnished silver. A long black ostrich plume
waved gracefully from a drab slouch hat cocked
up on one side and held by a clasp which also
stayed the plume.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>The same authority, Gunner Neese, tells an
amusing story about himself during this review.
He says that, as acting first sergeant of his
battery, he was riding at the head of the horse
artillery, mounted on a mule with ears about a
foot long. Just before the artillery arrived at
the reviewing stand, the searching eye of General
Stuart, who was very fastidious in all things,
spied the waving ears of the mule and he quickly
dispatched an aide to tell the captain to order
the mule and his rider off the field. Neese says
that he was not greatly surprised at the order,
but that the mule was.</p>
<p>For sometime General Hooker had wanted to
know what was going on behind the dense
screen of cavalry that Stuart had collected at
Culpeper, for it was evident that General Lee
was planning an important movement. Just
two days after the big review, Hooker sent to
find out, and for once the Federal cavalry took
Stuart by surprise. General Pleasanton marched
cautiously to the north bank of the Rappahannock,
at Beverly&rsquo;s Ford, with three divisions
of cavalry and five brigades of infantry. No
fires were allowed in the Federal camp, and
every precaution was taken to prevent the
Confederate pickets on the south bank from
discovering the presence of the large force.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Stuart&rsquo;s brigades, under Fitz Lee, Robertson,
W. H. F. Lee, and Jones, were encamped near
the fords of the Rappahannock in readiness to
cross the river the next morning and protect the
flank of Lee&rsquo;s army which was already beginning
its northward movement. Four batteries of
horse artillery were encamped in the edge of the
woods, in advance of Jones&rsquo;s brigade, near St.
James Church. This church was about two
hundred yards to the west of the direct road to
Beverly&rsquo;s Ford and was about two miles from
the ford.</p>
<p>Stuart himself camped on Fleetwood Hill,
half a mile east of Brandy Station and four
miles from Beverly&rsquo;s Ford. As an early start
was ordered for the next morning, all of Stuart&rsquo;s
camp equipage was packed in wagons in readiness
for the move. Pickets were placed at all
fords and the weary men slept, unaware of the
lurking enemy.</p>
<p>At dawn on June 9, General Pleasanton divided
his command into two columns and sent
one, under Brigadier-General Gregg, to cross the
river at Kelly&rsquo;s Ford, four miles below the railroad
bridge, and to gain the road to Culpeper
Courthouse. The other column, under General
Buford, was ordered to cross at Beverly&rsquo;s Ford
and proceed toward Brandy Station. This advance
was gallantly disputed by the Confederate
pickets at the ford, but being greatly outnumbered
they were retiring slowly toward St. James
Church when Major Flournoy with about one
hundred men charged down the road upon the
advancing regiments. The colonel who was
leading the Federal charge was killed and the
troops were driven back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>But the skirmishes of the picket force and the
charge of Major Flournoy had given General
Jones time to draw up his men in line of battle
and to withdraw the artillery from its exposed
position. General Jones then charged to the
support of Major Flournoy. This charge was
repelled by the Federals, and Jones retired to
his line of battle at St. James Church where he
was soon joined by the brigades of Hampton
and W. H. F. Lee.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic29">

<p class="caption">MAP OF BATTLE OF BRANDY STATION</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>From ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the battle
raged furiously. The Confederates advanced,
but were met by Federal troops that charged
gallantly across an open field up to the very
muzzles of the cannon which were sending
forth shell and canister into their midst. They
advanced, however, too far beyond their guns
and, being attacked on both flanks, they retreated
with heavy loss.</p>
<p>Stuart, who had hastened to the front to
dispute the march of Buford, was suddenly
threatened by more serious danger in the rear.</p>
<p>The gallant Colonel Butler had been left
with a regiment of South Carolina cavalry to
guard Brandy Station, two miles in the rear of
St. James Church and just half a mile from
Fleetwood Hill where Stuart&rsquo;s headquarters had
been located for several weeks. While on duty
at Brandy Station, Colonel Butler was informed
by a scout that a body of Federal cavalry was
moving toward Stevensburg. This was a part
of the column that had been sent to Kelly&rsquo;s
Ford early in the morning. General Gregg had
driven in the Confederate pickets at the ford,
and although General Robertson moved at once
to the help of his pickets, he was too late to
prevent General Gregg from sending a considerable
force toward Stevensburg which was
on the direct road to Culpeper Courthouse
where General Lee was encamped. General
Gregg himself, with the remainder of his force,
marched on toward Brandy Station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<div class="img" id="pic30">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="476" />
<p class="caption">THE BATTLE OF BRANDY STATION</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Colonel Butler knew that it was most important
to keep the Federals from finding out
that Lee&rsquo;s army was at Culpeper, and as soon
as he heard that they were marching along the
Stevensburg road, he advanced without orders
down that road. After a fierce fight, he stopped
the advance of the Federals who turned back to
join Gregg at Brandy Station.</p>
<p>In the meantime, General Gregg had marched
to the station where, Colonel Butler being
absent, he met no opposing force. From this
point, he immediately passed on to Fleetwood
Hill which that morning had been vacated by
General Stuart as headquarters. Stuart had
left there Major H. B. McClellan and several
couriers, with orders for all brigades and regiments
to communicate with him at that place.
These staff officers saw Gregg&rsquo;s large forces
approaching and knew that they must hold the
hill at any cost, as it was the key to Stuart&rsquo;s
whole position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>In Major McClellan&rsquo;s <i>Life of Stuart</i> he gives
us a very vivid and accurate account of the combats
which raged up and down and over the
crest of Fleetwood Hill. He says that every
vestige of the camp had been removed and
there remained upon the hill only McClellan and
the couriers. A six-pound howitzer, which for
want of ammunition had been sent back from the
fight going on at St. James Church, was halted
at the foot of the hill and later proved their
salvation. As soon as the young major saw the
long Federal columns approaching, he dispatched
a courier to General Stuart with information
of this movement. For fear that
some accident might befall the first courier, he
sent a second, praying for help lest the entire
force be enclosed between the divisions of
Buford and Gregg.</p>
<p>Finding some round shot and imperfect shells
in the limber chest, Major McClellan ordered
the howitzer to be brought up the hill and a
slow fire to be opened upon the rapidly-advancing
Federals. The fire caused surprise and a
halt. It seemed to indicate the presence of a
considerable force.</p>
<p>General Gregg, therefore, made preparations
for a serious attack upon the hill, and opened
fire with three rifled guns. But Major McClellan
and the men with their one gun, held the
hill until help came. Reenforcements promptly
sent by General Stuart arrived just as the
lieutenant in charge of the gun had fired his last
cartridge and the Federal cavalry was advancing
&ldquo;in magnificent order of columns of squadrons,
with flags and guidons flying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>There now followed a number of combats
which for dash and bravery have rarely been
equaled. First the Confederates, then the
Federals, seemed to have possession of the hill.
Stuart himself soon arrived, bringing Hampton
and Jones from the other firing line to help hold
this important position. Back and forth swept
the blue and the gray, each fighting stubbornly
and well. For a brief space of time, the New
Jersey cavalry held the hill. Soon they were
repulsed by a charge led by the Virginia cavalry.
There was a fierce contest at the foot of the hill
over three Federal guns. The Confederates
charged and took the guns, but were driven
back by overwhelming numbers and forced
to cut their way out. About this time, Hampton
came up with his four regiments formed in
columns of squadrons with a battery of four
guns. As they advanced at a gallop, they saw
the crest of Fleetwood Hill covered with Federal
cavalry. Passing the eastern side of the hill,
they struck the column just beyond the railroad
and there followed a fierce hand-to-hand
fight. When the smoke and dust of the conflict
lifted, it was seen that Hampton had won.
The Federals were retiring. At the same time, a
charge had been made straight up the hill on the
northeast side by Georgia and South Carolina
cavalry. A saber charge was made and the hill
was cleared of the opposing troops. As soon as
the Confederates gained the summit of the hill,
three batteries were placed in position there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Fleetwood Hill was now in the possession of
the Confederates, but the Federals still held
Brandy Station. Stuart at once brought up
a regiment which charged on both sides of the
road to the station, drove out the Federals and
pursued them for some distance.</p>
<p>While the battle was raging at Fleetwood Hill,
W. H. F. Lee with a small force held the Confederate
lines near St. James Church. There
was a lull in the fighting while Buford was
retiring some of his cavalry and bringing up
fresh troops, and so Stuart was able to withdraw
both Hampton and Jones, in order to repel the
attack on Fleetwood Hill.</p>
<p>As soon as the Federals were driven from
Brandy Station, Stuart formed a new line of
battle between the church and the station, where
he received a heavy Federal onset. This battle
was waged with varied success, but at last
Gregg joined Buford and late in the evening
the Federals retired across the river,&mdash;defeated
in spite of their superior numbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The losses in the battle of Brandy Station
were heavy on both sides. The Federal loss was
nearly 1,000 officers and men, while the Confederate
loss was over 500. The Federals were
forced to leave in the hands of the Confederates
three cannon, six flags, and nearly 500 prisoners.
Pleasanton was really driven back by Stuart
and the cavalry, but he claimed that as he had
found out that there was a force of infantry at
Culpeper Courthouse, which was the information
he had been sent to obtain, he retired as
soon as possible after he had been joined by
Gregg.</p>
<p>Gunner Neese tells us that several times during
the day he saw General Stuart, when the battle
raged fiercest, dash with his staff across the
field and pass from point to point along the line,
perfectly heedless of the surrounding danger.
During the engagement, Neese fired his faithful
gun one hundred and sixty times. Just before
the battle closed in the evening he saw the fire
flash from the cascabel of his gun and found
that it was disabled forever&mdash;burnt out entirely
at the breech.</p>
<p>We have described this battle at length
because it is considered one of the greatest
cavalry combats of the nineteenth century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1863</span></h2>
<p>Stuart did not attempt to follow Pleasanton,
because Lee&rsquo;s plan for the invasion of the North
would not allow the useless sacrifice of men and
horses. Indeed, all of the cavalry was needed
to screen his army as it marched through the
Blue Ridge gaps into the Valley, from which
point it was to cross the Potomac into Maryland.</p>
<p>While Longstreet&rsquo;s corps, which was the last
to move from Culpeper, was advancing to the
Valley, Stuart and his cavalry had a hard time
trying to protect Ashby&rsquo;s and Snicker&rsquo;s gaps,
through which Longstreet&rsquo;s forces would have to
pass. The battles of Aldie, Middleburg, and
Upperville, severe cavalry engagements in
which Stuart&rsquo;s forces were slowly forced back to
the foot of the Blue Ridge, were all fought to
protect these gaps until Longstreet could pass
through them on his northward march.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>On June 22, General Pleasanton, who had
forced General Stuart back from Upperville to
Ashby&rsquo;s Gap, withdrew, and Stuart moved
forward to Rector&rsquo;s Cross Roads, where he
could better watch the Federal movements.
On that same day, General Ewell, who commanded
the advance division of General Lee&rsquo;s
army, crossed the Potomac. By June 27, Lee&rsquo;s
entire army had reached Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Stuart was in Virginia
watching the Federals, in order to report to Lee
the moment that Hooker began to move. He
wrote General Lee that he thought he could
move with some of his cavalry around General
Hooker&rsquo;s rear into Maryland, thus throwing
himself between the Federals and Washington,
and so probably delay Hooker&rsquo;s northward
movement. General Lee wanted General
Stuart and his cavalry to join General Early
and guard his flank as he marched toward York,
Pennsylvania; he thought that Stuart could
reach him in this way just as easily as by crossing
at Shepherdstown where the rest of the army
crossed. Therefore, he gave Stuart permission
to cross at one of the lower fords, telling him to
annoy the Federals in the rear and collect all
possible supplies for the army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Major Von Borcke, the young Prussian officer,
had been severely wounded and Major McClellan
was now Stuart&rsquo;s adjutant general. He
tells us that on the night before General Stuart
started, a cold drizzling rain was falling, but
the general insisted on sleeping on the ground
under a tree, because he said his men were
exposed to the rain and he would not fare better
than they. He could have had more comfortable
quarters on the porch of a deserted house
near by, where McClellan, by the light of a
tallow &ldquo;dip,&rdquo; was receiving and writing dispatches.
When General Lee&rsquo;s letter, containing
instructions for Stuart&rsquo;s march, came, McClellan
carried it to the general, who quietly read
it, and then turned to go to sleep on his hard,
cold bed.</p>
<p>It was by such an example as this, as well as
by his bravery in battle, that Stuart won the
undying love of his soldiers. I am going to
quote for you a beautiful tribute paid him by
Mosby, his chief scout, who guided Stuart past
the Federal lines on the first part of this expedition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Mosby says that when he went to the general
for instructions before starting, &ldquo;he was in his
usual gay humor. I never saw him at any time
in any other. Always buoyant in spirits, he inspired
with his own high hopes all who came in
contact with him. I felt the deepest affection
for him. My chief ambition was to serve him.
He was the rare combination of the Puritan and
the knight-errant,&mdash;he felt intensely the joy of
battle and he loved the praise of fair women and
brave men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I served under him from the beginning of the
war until he closed his life, like Sidney, leading
a squadron on the field of honor. Yet I do not
remember that he ever gave me an order. There
was always so much sympathy between us and
I felt so much affection for him that he had only
to express a wish, that was an order for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In making their plans, neither Lee nor Stuart
had counted on an immediate northward movement
of the Federal army. Yet when Stuart
with three brigades passed eastward through a
gap in Bull Run Mountain, he found Hooker&rsquo;s
army already moving northward. He at once
sent General Lee a dispatch conveying this
valuable information, but the courier bearing it
never reached headquarters, and so Lee did not
know of this important movement until Hooker&rsquo;s
whole army had crossed the Potomac and
moved toward Frederick, Maryland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>It was now impossible for Stuart to cross the
river where he had intended, and it would take
too much time to retrace his steps and cross at
Shepherdstown, so he determined on the bold
move of crossing at Rowser&rsquo;s Ford, or Seneca,
only thirteen miles from Washington city. At
this point, the water was very deep and swift,
and the artillery had difficulty in crossing, but
time was too precious for them to seek a better
ford.</p>
<p>The caissons and limber chests were emptied
and dragged through the water, and the ammunition
was carried over in the hands of troopers.
By three o&rsquo;clock on the morning of June 28,
Stuart&rsquo;s command was on the Maryland side of
the river, but the whole Federal army now lay
between the cavalry and General Lee. Stuart
would have to march around this army before he
could obey Lee&rsquo;s order to join Early at York.</p>
<p>But General Lee had also told Stuart to
collect all the supplies that he could get for the
use of the army. He now had an opportunity to
carry out these instructions, for he met and
captured a long line of Federal supply wagons.</p>

<p>Fitz Lee&rsquo;s brigade tore up the track of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, burned the bridge,
and cut the telegraph wires, thus destroying the
line of communication between Washington city
and General Meade who had taken Hooker&rsquo;s
place as commander of the Federal forces. At
one time, Stuart&rsquo;s troopers were so near Washington
that they could see the dome of the Capitol,
and the whole North was in a panic lest the
dreaded Stuart should attack the city. General
Stuart, however, was hastening northward in
order to join General Early at York.</p>
<p>His long train of captured wagons seriously
hindered the rapid movement of his horsemen,
but he was unwilling to abandon these supplies
that he knew were so greatly needed by Lee&rsquo;s
army.</p>
<p>If, however, he could have foreseen the events
of the next few days he would have burned the
wagons and hurried by forced marches to join
General Lee who had to fight the first two
days&rsquo; battle at Gettysburg without the valuable
aid of Stuart and his cavalry. But Stuart
acted in the light of what he knew and did
what seemed best at the time, holding on to his
valuable prize in spite of the fact that it delayed
his march to York nearly two days.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 30, Stuart had a
sharp encounter with cavalry, at Hanover,
Pennsylvania, and at one time it seemed that he
would have to give up his captured wagons.
He already had them parked, so that they could
easily be burned if he was compelled to leave
them, but Hampton&rsquo;s and Fitz Lee&rsquo;s brigades,
which had been guarding the wagons in the rear,
came up and the Federals were dislodged.
Stuart remained at Hanover until night, in order
to hold the Federals in check, while the wagon
trains were sent toward York under the protection
of Fitz Lee&rsquo;s brigade.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Major McClellan tells us that this night&rsquo;s
march was terrible to both the troopers and the
drivers of the wagons. The men were hungry
and exhausted, and so were the mules. Every
time a wagon stopped, it caused a halt along the
whole line, and as the drivers were constantly
falling asleep, these halts occurred very frequently.
It required the utmost vigilance on
the part of every officer on Stuart&rsquo;s staff to keep
the train in motion.</p>
<p>When Fitz Lee reached the road leading from
York to Gettysburg, he learned that Early had
already marched westward. When Stuart arrived
at this point, he sent out couriers to find Early
and locate the other Confederate forces. He
then pushed immediately on to Carlisle where
he hoped to obtain provisions for his weary and
hungry troops, but when he reached Carlisle,
he found it already in possession of the Federals.</p>
<p>Smith, the Federal general in command, was
summoned to surrender, but he replied, &ldquo;If you
want the city, come and take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stuart was preparing to storm the city when
he received orders from General Lee to move at
once toward Gettysburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>For eight days and nights, Stuart&rsquo;s men had
been almost continually on the march and had
been surrounded by superior cavalry forces, but
he reached Gettysburg on the evening of the
second of July, in time to take part in the third
day&rsquo;s battle. He delivered to the quartermaster
one hundred and twenty-five captured wagons
and teams. He would willingly have sacrificed
this valuable prize could he have been on hand
two days earlier to assist his beloved chief in
the battle that had been unexpectedly forced
at this point, but in which he held his ground
during two days of stubborn fighting.</p>
<p>General Lee&rsquo;s plan for the third day&rsquo;s battle
was to have General Longstreet&rsquo;s corps storm
the Federal center in its strongly-fortified
position upon Cemetery Ridge. Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry
was to march unobserved to the Federal rear.
Here it was to attack, thus protecting the Confederate
left flank and drawing attention away
from the forces which were to storm Cemetery
Ridge.</p>
<p>About noon on the third of July, Stuart led
two brigades along the York turnpike and took
position on Cross Ridge in the rear of the
Federal line of battle. Hampton and Fitz Lee
were ordered to follow as soon as they were
supplied with ammunition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>On the slope of Cross Ridge stood a stone
dairy, and farther down in the valley was a barn
belonging to a farmer named Rummel. Concealing
his men in the woods on the top of the
hill, Stuart pushed forward a gun and fired a
number of shots, probably to notify General
Lee that he had gained a good position on the
left flank. He then sent word for Hampton and
Fitz Lee to hasten, as he wished to attack the
Federal rear. While waiting for them, he sent
some dismounted cavalry to hold the Rummel
barn and a fence to the right of it.</p>

<br />THE TOLL OF WAR
<br />Dead Confederate sharpshooters on the battlefield of Gettysburg</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Before Fitz Lee and Hampton came up,
Stuart saw that he had stirred up a hornet&rsquo;s nest.
The Federal cavalry had discovered his movements
and were ready for him. A battery of six
guns opened fire upon his gun and soon disabled
it. Then a strong line of sharpshooters advanced
and a fierce fight took place near the barn. On
the left, the Confederate sharpshooters drove
the Federals for some distance across the field.
Just then a large force of Federal cavalry appeared
and drove back the Confederate dismounted
men almost to the Rummel barn.
There the Federals were met and driven back
by the Confederates, but the Federals were
reenforced and returned. Hampton advanced to
the charge, and the battle surged back and
forth over the open field in a hand-to-hand fight
with pistols and sabers, until nearly all of
Hampton&rsquo;s and Fitz Lee&rsquo;s regiments were engaged.</p>
<p>At last the Federals retired to the line held at
the beginning of the fight and the Confederates
held the Rummel barn. There followed an
artillery duel which lasted until night. Then
Stuart withdrew to the York turnpike, leaving
a regiment of cavalry picketed around the barn
which was full of wounded Confederates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Stuart encamped that night on the York road.
Early the next morning, he withdrew in the rain
and rejoined the main army on the heights west
of Gettysburg. The Confederates under Pickett
had stormed the Federal heights opposite and
had taken the guns, but as Hood, who was to
support the charge was detained by the Federal
cavalry, they could not hold their position, and
finally had to retreat with the loss of many lives.
The Federals did not pursue the Confederates,
but remained the whole of the next day upon
their entrenched heights.</p>
<p>Being now nearly out of ammunition and
supplies for his men, General Lee ordered a
retreat on the night of July 4. He had a difficult
task to perform. But happily his army
had not been routed nor had the men lost
confidence in him. As long as he was leading,
they were willing to go anywhere and to
endure anything.</p>
<p>He had now before him a long march, and he
was encumbered with four thousand prisoners
and a wagon train fifteen miles long. It would
take great skill and courage to conduct his army
safely back into Virginia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>In this extremity, he relied on his cavalry for
aid. Both men and horses were by this time
reduced in numbers and were worn out by hunger
and fatigue. They, however, took promptly
the position assigned by General Lee and
guarded the army and its trains from the
attacks of the Federal cavalry. General Stuart&rsquo;s
command guarded both wings of the army,&mdash;Stuart
himself being on one side and Fitz Lee
on the other. They, of course, were pursued by
the Federal cavalry, and before they reached
the fords of the Potomac, both Stuart and Fitz
Lee had been engaged in several skirmishes.</p>
<p>The wagon train reached Williamsport on
July 6, and found the river too much swollen
to cross. The wagons were massed in a narrow
space near the river and were guarded by a small
force. Here they were attacked by General
Buford. This engagement is called &ldquo;the
Teamsters&rsquo; Battle,&rdquo; because the teamsters assisted
the troopers so well in holding the Federals
in check. Together they succeeded in resisting
the attack of Buford until the arrival of Stuart
who had been engaged in driving the Federal
cavalry from Hagerstown. A little later, Fitz
Lee came thundering down the Greencastle road.
Buford then retired without having taken or
destroyed the trains so important to Lee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>On July 7, when the infantry and artillery
arrived at Hagerstown from which Stuart
had driven the Federal cavalry the day before,
General Lee was not able to cross the Potomac.
He, therefore, selected a strong position
and fortified it while waiting for the waters
to fall. From July 8 to 12, Stuart protected
the front of Lee&rsquo;s army, fighting a number of
battles. Then, all the Federal forces having
come up, Stuart retired to the main body of
the army and General Lee prepared for battle.
But Meade, who was very cautious, thought
Lee&rsquo;s position too strong to attack.</p>
<p>Major McClellan, General Stuart&rsquo;s adjutant
general, says in his <i>Life of Stuart</i> that those
days will be remembered by the cavalry
leader&rsquo;s staff as days of great hardship. The
country had been swept bare of provisions and
nothing could be purchased. Scanty rations had
been issued to the men, but none to the officers.
For four or five days, they received all the food
that they had from a young lady in Hagerstown,
whose father, a Southerner, loved the
Confederacy. After a day of incessant fighting,
Stuart and his officers reached the house of this
friend about nine o&rsquo;clock at night. While food
was being prepared, Stuart fell asleep on the
sofa in the parlor. When supper was announced,
he refused to rise. Knowing that he had eaten
nothing for twenty-four hours, Major McClellan
took him by the arm and compelled him
to take his place at the table. He ate sparingly
and without relish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Thinking that the supper did not suit him,
their kind hostess inquired: &ldquo;General, perhaps
you would like to have a hard-boiled egg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take four or five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This singular reply caused a good deal of
astonishment, but nothing was said at the time.
The eggs were brought in; Stuart broke one
and ate it, and rose from the table.</p>
<p>When they returned to the parlor, Major
McClellan sat down at the piano and commenced
singing,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;If you want to have a good time</p>
<p class="t0">Jine the cavalry.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The circumstances hardly made the song
appropriate, but the chorus roused the general
and he joined in it with a right good will. During
all that time, he had been unconscious of his
surroundings, and when told of his seeming
rudeness to his hostess he hastened to make
apologies.</p>
<p>This little incident shows how greatly Stuart
was exhausted by the strain and fatigue of
sleepless days and nights during this unfortunate
campaign. For more than two weeks, he
had been almost constantly in the saddle, using
both mind and body in the effort to save his
command and to bring the Confederate army
back to Virginia without serious disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>On July 13, the waters had subsided so much
that General Lee gave orders for the army to
cross the river that night. By one o&rsquo;clock
the next afternoon, the southern army was
again in Virginia, General Stuart&rsquo;s command
bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>The Federals, strange to say, offered little
opposition and the crossing was a complete
success. The Federal government and the
northern people were much disappointed when
they learned that General Lee had so skillfully
led his army out of its perilous position. They
had expected that General Meade would destroy
it, hemmed in between the flooded Potomac
and the Federal army so superior in numbers.
Lee now moved back to Bunker Hill near
Winchester. Stuart repelled an advance of the
Federal cavalry and drove it steadily back to
within a mile of Shepherdstown. Here a large
number of the troopers were dismounted and
advanced in line of battle. The Federals retreated
slowly until dark when they withdrew
from the contest in the direction of Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry, having lost heavily in killed and wounded.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">FINAL CAMPAIGNS AND DEATH</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">1863-&rsquo;64</span></h2>
<p>General Meade now advanced into Virginia
and attempted to follow General Lee and cut
him off from Richmond. Lee being at once informed
by Stuart of the movement, skillfully
eluded his foe and by the first of August, had
placed his army behind the Rappahannock river,
between Meade and Richmond.</p>
<p>The cavalry now had a short period of rest.
The whole force was reorganized, and Hampton
and Fitz Lee were promoted to the rank of
major general. This much-needed rest was
broken on September 13, by the advance of
the Federals into Culpeper county. Stuart
had been warned of their forward movement,
and at once started his wagons and disabled
horses toward Rapidan Station. General Lee
supposing that General Meade was advancing
in force, had already retired behind the Rapidan
river and placed his army in a very strong
position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Early on the morning of Sept. 13, the Federal
cavalry advanced in large numbers to the fords
of the Rappahannock. As Lee did not intend
to hold Culpeper county, Stuart retired toward
Rapidan Station, keeping up a running fight as
he withdrew.</p>
<p>A few days later, Stuart came in touch with
Buford&rsquo;s cavalry near Jack&rsquo;s Shop in Madison
county, and attacked them in several
spirited charges. He was unable, however,
to drive back these forces. Unwilling to retreat,
he advanced and was engaged in a
furious combat when he was informed that
Kilpatrick&rsquo;s command was in his rear. As he
withdrew to meet this unexpected foe, Buford
pressed forward and it seemed for a time that
Stuart had at last been caught in a place from
which he could not escape.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick had already thrown a large force of
dismounted men between Stuart and the river,
and he was thus enclosed between two large
forces of finely-mounted men. Buford pressed
forward until the battle was brought into a field
in the center of which a small hill afforded a good
position for Stuart&rsquo;s artillery. He now divided
his regiments and guns&mdash;some to fight Buford,
some to fight Kilpatrick. At last, Kilpatrick&rsquo;s
main force was driven back and one of Stuart&rsquo;s
regiments dashed up to the fence behind which
Kilpatrick&rsquo;s dismounted men were firing, threw it
down, and made way for Stuart to retire. Withdrawing
rapidly, Stuart then crossed the ford
at Liberty Mills where he was very soon reenforced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>On October 9, General Lee commenced the
movement around the right of General Meade&rsquo;s
army which is called the &ldquo;Bristoe Campaign.&rdquo;
In this campaign, the cavalry was sorely tried.
Fitz Lee&mdash;who, as you have been told, had
been promoted to the rank of major general&mdash;was
left at Raccoon Ford, supported by
two brigades of infantry, to hold Lee&rsquo;s line and
to make Meade believe that Lee&rsquo;s whole army
was still encamped at that place. Stuart with
Hampton&rsquo;s division moved to the right of Lee&rsquo;s
army as it again marched northward; it was his
duty to prevent the Federals from finding out
Lee&rsquo;s movements and to protect the army from
attacks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Now followed a series of sharp engagements
between the cavalry of the two armies. There
was a skirmish near James City after which the
Federals retired toward Culpeper Courthouse.
The next morning, Stuart followed them. Three
miles from the Courthouse, he met and drove
in the Federal pickets. But he now found out
that Meade was retreating from the Rappahannock
and that Fitz Lee, who had fought a battle
at Raccoon Ford, was advancing towards
Brandy Station,&mdash;fighting Buford as he marched.</p>
<p>Stuart knew that Kilpatrick was at Culpeper
Courthouse awaiting his attack, but on receiving
this news he turned at once northward
toward Brandy Station, hoping to join Fitz Lee
and get possession of Fleetwood Hill from which
he had driven the Federal cavalry in June. If
he could carry out this plan, he would cut off
Kilpatrick from Buford. Kilpatrick, who had
massed his force of about four thousand men on
the open space east of the Courthouse at
Culpeper waiting the attack of Stuart, soon
found out that the latter had eluded him and
was hurrying toward Brandy Station. He,
therefore, began a race for the same position.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Stuart was delayed by a
skirmish with Federal forces and when he came
in sight of Brandy Station, he saw that Kilpatrick
had beaten him in the race. Buford, who was
being pursued by Fitz Lee, had already taken
possession of Fleetwood Hill and placed his artillery
upon its crest. Stuart had moved so rapidly
that he had left his artillery far behind, but
Fitz Lee&rsquo;s guns were booming as he came into
position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Fitz Lee joined Stuart and they at once attacked
Kilpatrick&rsquo;s and Buford&rsquo;s forces, now
under the command of Major-General Pleasanton.
The Federals fought bravely, but they
were steadily pushed toward their position on
Fleetwood Hill. It was now late in the afternoon,
and Stuart, declining to attack them in
their strong position, sent Fitz Lee to the left
as if to cut off the Federals from the river. As
soon as Pleasanton perceived this flanking
movement, he withdrew from Fleetwood Hill
and, protected by his artillery, crossed the river.
Stuart&rsquo;s weary troopers camped that night once
more around Brandy Station, well pleased at
having gained a decided victory over such large
forces.</p>
<p>Two days later, Stuart reached Warrenton
where the whole army was encamped and he
immediately received orders to proceed toward
Catlett&rsquo;s Station with two thousand men and
seven guns, for the purpose of gaining accurate
information about the position of Meade&rsquo;s army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>General Meade had started his forces back
toward Culpeper Courthouse to engage General
Lee in battle, but he found out that Lee was
marching around his right, so as to get between
him and Washington city. On receiving this
information, Meade at once recalled his forces.
These movements and countermovements came
near resulting disastrously to Stuart who was
caught between the advancing and retreating
divisions of the Federals.</p>
<p>When he reached Catlett&rsquo;s Station, he found
that a column of Federal infantry was moving
toward that place. He at once fell back on the
road to Warrenton and found another Federal
corps in his rear. His situation was now one of
great peril. It seemed that his force would either
be captured or cut to pieces.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when Stuart perceived his
danger he was emerging from a piece of woods
and night was closing in. He at once retired his
command to the depths of the woods and called
a council of his officers. They were so near the
enemy that the neighing of a horse or the clash
of a saber could be heard, and to make retreat
impossible, they were hemmed in on one side
by a swollen stream and on the other side by a
forest. At first, it was proposed to leave the
seven guns and cut their way out. Stuart,
however, would not agree to abandon his artillery.
At last, officers went through the command
and ordered each man to stand by his
horse&rsquo;s head, and to make no sound himself nor
let his horse make any.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>As soon as it was dark, Stuart ordered four
trusted men to make their way to General Lee at
Culpeper Courthouse. They were to inform
him of the dangerous position of the cavalry and
ask him to send aid as soon as possible. Then
followed long hours of anxious waiting. During
the night, a Federal corps marched past the
front of Stuart&rsquo;s position, but fortunately the
noise of the moving column prevented the
Federals from detecting the presence of the
Confederates within the woods.</p>
<p>At the first peep of day, the Confederates discovered
that a large force of Federal infantry
had halted near, had stacked arms, and were
getting breakfast. They were so near the Confederates
that several of their officers who
strayed into the woods were captured. In the
dim light of morning, each soldier in gray
tightened the girth of his hungry, weary steed
and mounted silently, with weapons ready for
the charge. The seven guns were parked near
the west of the hill, just opposite the feasting
Federals. Then the men waited,&mdash;waited either
to be discovered by the Federals when the
bright sunlight should flash upon their gray
coats or to hear Lee&rsquo;s guns as a signal for them
to attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>At last! There was firing from toward Warrenton.
Aid was approaching and the time had
come to cut their way out. In an instant, the
seven guns were pouring shot and shell upon the
surprised Federals. The horsemen then charged
upon the infantry regiments which had hastily
formed in line of battle and were advancing upon
the guns. A fierce combat now ensued in which
the Federals were driven back. The artillery
and wagons, followed closely by the horsemen,
passed behind the rear of the Federals and thus
the whole command escaped from its perilous
position.</p>
<p>General Meade now fell back to Centerville
and General Lee, having failed to cut off General
Meade from Washington, retired again to the
line of the Rappahannock. Stuart continued to
follow the Federal cavalry, having skirmishes at
Bull Run, Groveton, and Frying Pan Church.</p>
<p>A few days later, the Confederate cavalry
defeated a large force of infantry near Buckland,
in a battle that is known as the &ldquo;Buckland
Races.&rdquo; After a sharp skirmish, Stuart fell
back slowly toward Warrenton in order to draw
the Federals after him; for Fitz Lee was moving
forward from Warrenton to attack them in the
rear. Stuart, as soon as he heard the sound of
Fitz Lee&rsquo;s guns, turned suddenly upon the
Federals with so furious a charge that their lines
were broken and put to flight. Stuart chased
them for five miles and captured two hundred
and fifty prisoners and eight wagons and ambulances.
Thus he may be said to have fairly won
the race back to Buckland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Soon after this, both armies went into winter
quarters. The Federal soldiers had comforts
and even luxuries, while the Confederates were
poorly clothed and fed. Their sufferings during
this bitter cold winter could not have been endured
but for the food and clothing sent from
their homes. Officers and men fared alike; the
resources of the Confederacy were at a low ebb.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuart was boarding at Orange Courthouse,
and, as General Stuart&rsquo;s headquarters
were near by, he was able to spend some time
with his family again. And a very happy family
it was now, for on the ninth of the previous
October, the very day that began Stuart&rsquo;s heavy
work in the Bristoe Campaign, a daughter had
come to comfort him and Mrs. Stuart for the
loss of their little Flora. The devoted father
named this little baby Virginia Pelham, in honor
of his beloved state and in memory of the gallant
young leader of the Stuart Horse Artillery whom
he had loved so well. The members of General
Stuart&rsquo;s staff were all devoted to this new
member of the family, and General Lee, whose
headquarters were not far distant, came more
than once to visit Mrs. Stuart and &ldquo;Miss
Virginia,&rdquo; as he called the little lady. The
admiration paid his little daughter gave Stuart
great delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Late in February, 1864, the Federal cavalry
made an attempt to take Richmond. This
movement was known as &ldquo;Dahlgren&rsquo;s Raid&rdquo;
and the large Federal forces were fitted out with
great care. But in spite of their superior numbers,
they were driven back by Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry.</p>
<p>On March 17, General U. S. Grant was placed
in command of all the Federal armies. As it
was evident that the great struggle of the year
would take place in Virginia, he took charge of
General Meade&rsquo;s army and prepared it for the
coming campaign. He had an army of 125,000
men, fully equipped, and with all that money
could buy.</p>
<p>At midnight on May 3, the Federal army
began to advance. General Lee permitted
it to cross the Rapidan and march into the
Wilderness where the battle of Chancellorsville
had been fought the year before. In this jungle,
it would be difficult for the Federals to use their
artillery and they would be compelled to fight
at a disadvantage. General Grant expected
General Lee to retreat to a line nearer Richmond,
and he was surprised when his troops
plunged into the dense woods and thickets of the
Wilderness to find General Lee ready to fight
on ground of his own choosing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>As soon as the news was received at the cavalry
headquarters that the Federals had crossed the
fords of the Rapidan, Stuart set out for his
picket line. He conducted in person the
advances of the infantry until the lines of the
enemy were reached, and on May 6 and 7 the
great Battle of the Wilderness raged furiously.</p>
<p>The cavalry did heavy work on the Confederate
right. Gunner Neese, in his diary,
tells an interesting anecdote of Stuart on the
morning of the second day&rsquo;s battle.</p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;Our orders to hasten to the front
this morning at daylight were pressing and
urgent, and we had no time to prepare or eat
breakfast, which greatly ruffled some of our
drivers. When we drew near to the enemy&rsquo;s
line we awaited orders, and one of our drivers
was still going through baby acts about something
to eat and having no breakfast. Just
then General Stuart and staff came along and
halted a moment right in the road where we
were and heard the grumbling and childish
murmuring of our hungry man, and the general
rode up to him and gave him two biscuits out
of his own haversack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>On the night of May 7, Grant began to move
his army by the left flank to get between
Lee and Richmond, but the movement was discovered
at once and Fitz Lee&rsquo;s cavalry was sent
forward to delay the Federals until Longstreet&rsquo;s
infantry could come up. Fitz Lee&rsquo;s men were
at times dismounted, and they fought so stubbornly
that Grant&rsquo;s forces were held in check
until the infantry by a rapid night march reached
the entrenchments which had been hastily
thrown up near Spotsylvania Courthouse.</p>
<p>I am going to tell you about the arrival of the
infantry and the beginning of the next morning&rsquo;s
battle in the words of a private of the First Virginia
cavalry.</p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;We had been fighting and retreating
all night, and at last, when near
Spotsylvania Courthouse had thrown up slight
entrenchments. Protected by Breathed&rsquo;s guns,
we were awaiting another attack. Suddenly
we heard the steady march of infantry coming
in our rear. The old fellows came swinging
along in the moonlight, each one with his camp-kettle
on his back and his long musket with its
gleaming bayonet resting easily on his shoulder.
Each man settled down by a dismounted trooper,
glad to rest a little while, but full of quips and
jokes. &lsquo;Look here sonny,&rsquo; said one to me,
picking up my carbine, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s this here thing
for? Ef I was you I&rsquo;d be feared of it; it might
hurt somebody!&rsquo; But even talking was not
permitted. Officers passed along, enjoining
silence and ordering us not to fire until we could
see the whites of the Yankees&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;About daylight we heard loud cheering.
Major Breathed had brought off one of his guns
in the face of thousands of the enemy, and they
were cheering! On came a blue line of battle
eight deep calling out, &lsquo;Come out, you dismounted
cavalry! We know you are there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence reigned behind the earthworks, but
every gun was ready. When the Federals were
well over the crest of the hill, the order rang
along the line&mdash;&lsquo;Steady, aim, fire!&rsquo; Bang! went
the carbines and muskets, and with piercing yells
the Confederates leaped out of the works and
rushed with gleaming bayonets upon the already
retreating foe. The veterans had delivered so
fierce and so well-directed a fire that the attack
was not renewed at that position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short while afterward, Stuart arrived with
reenforcements. Major McClellan was the only
member of General Stuart&rsquo;s staff present during
the brisk skirmishes of the morning. He says
that Stuart exposed himself recklessly to the
fire of the Federals, in spite of the earnest request
of the infantry officers that he would retire to a
safer position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>He sent Major McClellan on such seemingly
unnecessary messages that after a while that
officer thought that General Stuart was trying
to shield him from danger, so he said, &ldquo;General,
my horse is weary. You are exposing yourself
and you are alone. Please let me remain with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Stuart merely smiled kindly and sent him
with another message.</p>
<p>When Grant reached Spotsylvania Courthouse,
he decided to send a corps of cavalry
forward on a raid toward Richmond. This
force was to cut Lee&rsquo;s communication, take
Richmond, and be in position to attack the rear
of Lee&rsquo;s army after Grant crushed him at
Spotsylvania. General Sheridan commanded
these troops that started for Richmond, along
the Telegraph Road.</p>
<p>General Fitz Lee who saw them, says: &ldquo;Ten
thousand horsemen riding in a single road in
column of fours made a column thirteen miles
in length; and with flashing sabers and fluttering
guidons were an imposing array.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>To contend with this force, Stuart had only
three small brigades, yet on him depended the
safety of Richmond and the protection of the
rear of Lee&rsquo;s army. At Jarrold&rsquo;s Mill, Wickham&rsquo;s
brigade had a sharp skirmish with Sheridan&rsquo;s
rear guard and captured a number of
prisoners. Yet on and on marched Sheridan,
leaving the Telegraph Road, and going toward
Beaver Dam Station. At Mitchell&rsquo;s Shop,
Sheridan&rsquo;s rear guard having been reenforced,
made another stand. Wickham attacked again,
but would have been forced back by the greatly-superior
numbers of the Federals had not Stuart
and Fitz Lee come up with reenforcements and
the Federals passed on.</p>
<p>At Beaver Dam Station, Stuart left his
command a short while to see if his wife and
children, who were near by at the home of Mr.
Edmund Fontaine, had escaped annoyance
from the Federals. Having found them safe
and well, he pressed on toward Hanover Junction
to place his forces between Sheridan and
Richmond.</p>
<p>Hanover Junction was reached after dark and
Stuart proposed an all-night march. Fitz Lee&rsquo;s
men, however, were worn out with fighting and
marching and, at the request of their commander,
Stuart at last consented that the
troopers should rest until one o&rsquo;clock. He
directed that his trusted adjutant, Major
McClellan, should remain awake to arouse the
sleeping men, and to see them mounted and on
the march at the time mentioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Major McClellan in his <i>Life of Stuart</i>, says:
&ldquo;When the troops had moved out, I returned to
Stuart and awoke him and his staff. While
they were preparing to move, I lay down to
catch, if possible, a few moments&rsquo; rest. The
party rode off as I lay in a half-conscious condition,
and I heard some one say, &lsquo;General,
here&rsquo;s McClellan fast asleep. Must I wake
him?&rsquo; &lsquo;No&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;he has been watching
while we were asleep. Leave a courier with
him and tell him to come on when his nap is
out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After taking a short rest, Major McClellan
rejoined General Stuart just as he passed the
road leading to Ashland. A squadron of Confederate
cavalry had come upon a force of
Federal cavalry in that town, and had dispersed
it with great loss to the latter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Stuart reached Yellow Tavern, about eight
miles from Richmond, about ten o&rsquo;clock on the
morning of May 11. He had beaten Sheridan
in the race to Richmond and placed himself
between that city and Sheridan&rsquo;s forces.
He at once posted his small force to meet the
Federal advance. Wickham was placed on the
right of the Telegraph Road and Lomax on the
left. Two guns were placed in the road and one
farther to the left. The whole force was dismounted,
except a portion of the cavalry which
was held in reserve.</p>
<p>General Stuart then sent Major McClellan
into Richmond to find out the condition of affairs
in the city. General Bragg, in charge of the
defense, replied that he had enough men to hold
the trenches and that he was hourly expecting
reenforcements from Petersburg&mdash;that he wished
General Stuart to remain on the Federal flank
and to retard its progress as much as possible.</p>
<p>General Stuart&rsquo;s last official dispatch written
on the morning of May 11, the day that he was
wounded, showed his wonderful determination
and unfailing cheerfulness in the face of danger
and difficulty, and was also a tribute to the men
who fought under him.</p>
<p>He wrote: &ldquo;May 11th, 1864, 6:30 A. M.
Fighting against immense odds of Sheridan&mdash;my
men and horses are tired, hungry, and
jaded, <i>but all right</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>About four o&rsquo;clock that same day, Sheridan
attacked the whole line, throwing a brigade of
cavalry upon the left. Stuart galloped to this
point, and found that the Federals had captured
his two guns and had driven back almost the
entire left. He at once ordered a reserve
squadron to charge the advancing Federals.
Just as the latter were being driven back in a
hand-to-hand combat, General Stuart rode up
to where Captain Dorsey and about eighty dismounted
men who had collected on the Telegraph
Road, were firing at the retreating
Federals. As the struggling mass fell back, one
of the Federals who had been unhorsed in the
fight, turned and fired his pistol directly at
General Stuart. The fatal shot entered his
body just above the sword-belt.</p>
<p>Captain Dorsey saw that the general was
wounded and hurried to his assistance. He
tried to lead the general&rsquo;s horse to a safer place,
but it became very unruly. General Stuart
insisted on being lifted off and allowed to rest
against a tree. Then he ordered the captain to
go back to his men, but Captain Dorsey refused
to do so until his general had been taken to the
rear. There were now only a few of Stuart&rsquo;s
men between him and the Federals and for a
few moments there was great danger of his being
captured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>But soon another horse was brought, and the
general was taken to a safer place by Captain
Dorsey and put in charge of Private Wheatley.
Wheatley speedily procured an ambulance, and
took the general to the rear. Here Dr. Fontaine
and two of the general&rsquo;s aides, Venable and
Hullihen, took charge of their wounded chief
and started at once to Richmond.</p>
<p>As the ambulance passed through the disordered
Confederate ranks the general called to his
men, &ldquo;Go back! go back and do your duty as I
have done, and our country will be safe. Go
back! go back! I had rather die than be
whipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were his last words upon the battlefield,
and they carried to his men a message,
full of the spirit of their beloved chief. They
did &lsquo;go back,&rsquo; and fought so well that Sheridan
was finally driven from Richmond.</p>
<p>The ambulance had to take a rough and roundabout
way, in order to avoid the Federals, and it
did not reach Richmond until after dark. The
general was taken to the home of his brother-in-law,
Dr. Charles Brewer. He had suffered
greatly on the trip, but had borne the pain with
fortitude and cheerfulness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>The next morning, Major McClellan, who
according to Stuart&rsquo;s orders had remained on
the battlefield, rode into the city to deliver to
General Bragg a message from General Fitz Lee
now in command of the cavalry. As soon as he
had delivered his message, he went at once to
the bedside of his wounded general. Inflammation
had set in, and the doctors said there was
no hope of Stuart&rsquo;s recovery. I shall let McClellan
tell you in his own words about the
general&rsquo;s last hours.</p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;After delivering General Fitz Lee&rsquo;s
message to General Bragg, I repaired to the
bedside of my dying chief. He was calm and
composed, in the full possession of his mind.
Our conversation was, however, interrupted by
paroxysms of suffering. He directed me to make
the proper disposal of his official papers, and
to send his personal effects to his wife.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic33">

<p class="caption">THE HOUSE IN WHICH STUART DIED
<br />This house has been torn down. The building erected on its site bears a tablet in memory of Stuart.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;He then said: &lsquo;I wish you to take one of my
horses and Venable the other. Which is the
heavier rider?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied that I thought Venable was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;let Venable have the gray
horse and you take the bay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon he spoke again: &lsquo;You will find in my
hat a small Confederate flag, which a lady of
Columbia, South Carolina, sent me, with the
request that I would wear it upon my horse in a
battle and then return it to her. Send it to her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, Major McClellan found the flag inside
the lining of the general&rsquo;s hat. Among his
papers was the letter conveying the lady&rsquo;s
request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again he said: &lsquo;My spurs which I have
always worn in battle, I promised to give to
Mrs. Lilly Lee, of Shepherdstown, Virginia.
My sword I leave to my son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I sat by his bed, the sound of cannon
outside the city was heard. He turned to me
eagerly and inquired what it meant. I explained
that Gracey&rsquo;s brigade and other troops
had moved out against the rear of the enemy
on the Brooke turnpike and that Fitz Lee
would endeavor to oppose their advance at
Meadow Bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;He turned his eyes upward, and exclaimed
earnestly, &lsquo;God grant that they may be successful.&rsquo;
Then turning his head aside, he said with
a sigh: &lsquo;But I must be prepared for another
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thought of duty was ever uppermost in
his mind, and after listening to the distant
cannonading for a few moments, he said,
&lsquo;Major, Fitz Lee may need you.&rsquo; I understood
his meaning and pressed his hand in a last
farewell. As I left his chamber, President
Davis entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking the general&rsquo;s hand he asked: &lsquo;General,
how do you feel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He replied: &lsquo;Easy, but willing to die if God
and my country think I have fulfilled my
destiny, and done my duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Dr. Peterkin visited him, and
prayed with him. He requested Dr. Peterkin
to sing &lsquo;Rock of Ages,&rsquo; and joined in the singing
of the hymn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the afternoon, he asked Dr. Brewer
whether it were not possible for him to survive
the night. The doctor frankly told him
that death was close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then said: &lsquo;I am resigned if it be God&rsquo;s
will; but I would like to see my wife. But God&rsquo;s
will be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again he said to Dr. Brewer: &lsquo;I am going
fast now; I am resigned. God&rsquo;s will be done.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Major Von Borcke, General Stuart&rsquo;s former
aide who had not yet recovered from his severe
wound, was also in Richmond. After McClellan
went away, Von Borcke remained at his
chieftain&rsquo;s side. He tells us that he sat on the
bed, holding the general&rsquo;s hand and handing
him crushed ice which he ate in great abundance
and which was applied to cool his burning
wound. Everyone was hoping that Mrs.
Stuart would arrive in time to be with him before
he passed from earth.</p>
<p>Finally the general drew Von Borcke to him,
and after bidding him farewell said, &ldquo;Look after
my family after I am gone and be the same
true friend to my wife and children that you
have been to me.&rdquo; These were his last connected
words.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock the end came, and it was
three hours later before Mrs. Stuart arrived.
The destruction of bridges and a fearful storm
had caused delay in the trip from Beaver Dam.
Owing to the telegraph lines being broken, the
tidings that General Stuart was wounded did
not reach his wife until noon on May 12.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>At the time of his death, May 12, Stuart
was just thirty-one years old. Yet through his
high ideals, his devotion to duty, and his military
genius, he had risen to a position of great
trust and honor in the service of his country
for which he laid down his life. Such a death,
crowning such a life, is glorious and inspiring.
One feels that Horatius, the noble Roman, indeed
spoke truly when he said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And how can man die better,</p>
<p class="t">Than by facing fearful odds,</p>
<p class="t0">For the ashes of his fathers</p>
<p class="t">And the temples of his gods?&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">SOME TRIBUTES TO STUART</span></h2>
<p>While General Stuart&rsquo;s life was ebbing away,
General Sheridan retired from the attack on
Richmond. The delay at Ashland and the
all-day fight at Yellow Tavern in which two
brigades of Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry had detained the
ten thousand men of Sheridan&rsquo;s command, had
given the authorities at Richmond time to
collect forces for the defense of the city.</p>
<p>General Fitz Lee who now commanded the
cavalry, harassed the retreat of Sheridan for a
while, but his men and horses were too worn-out
to attempt to cut off so large a force. Sheridan,
therefore, marched through the swamps of the
Chickahominy river to the Pamunkey, and
after an absence of more than two weeks,
rejoined Grant&rsquo;s army which was still vainly
attempting to get between Lee and Richmond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>General Fitz Lee in his <i>Life of General Robert
E. Lee</i>, says: &ldquo;Sheridan&rsquo;s raid would have been
the usual record of nothing accomplished and a
broken-down command except that at Yellow
Tavern the Confederate cavalry chieftain was
mortally wounded and died the next day in
Richmond. This sad occurrence was of more
value to the Federal cause than anything that
could have happened, and his loss to Lee was
irreparable. He was the army&rsquo;s eyes and ears&mdash;vigilant
always, bold to a fault, of great vigor
and ceaseless activity. He had a heart ever
loyal to his superior, and duty, was to him the
&lsquo;sublimest word in the language.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter to his wife a few days after General
Stuart&rsquo;s death, General Robert E. Lee said:
&ldquo;As I write, I expect to hear the sound of guns
every moment. I grieve for the loss of the
gallant officers and men, and miss their aid and
sympathy. A more zealous, ardent, brave, and
devoted soldier than Stuart the Confederacy
cannot have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>General Lee&rsquo;s order to the army announcing
the death of Stuart was as follows: &ldquo;Among
the gallant soldiers who have fallen in the war,
General Stuart was second to none in valor, in
zeal, and in unflinching devotion to his country.
His achievements form a conspicuous part of the
history of this army, with which his name and
services will be forever associated. To military
capacity of a high order, he added the brighter
graces of a pure life guided and sustained by the
Christian&rsquo;s faith and hope. The mysterious
hand of an all-wise God has removed him from
the scene of his usefulness and fame. His grateful
countrymen will mourn his loss and cherish
his memory. To his comrades in arms he has
left the proud recollection of his deeds and the
inspiring influence of his example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Wade Hampton&rsquo;s order to his cavalry
corps was also an eloquent tribute to the great
cavalry leader. It was as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the midst of rejoicing over the success of
our arms, the sad tidings come to us from
Richmond of the death of our distinguished
Chief of Cavalry. Death has at last accepted
the offering of a life, which before the admiring
eyes of the Army, has been so often, so freely
and so nobly offered, on almost every battlefield
of Virginia. In the death of Major-General
J. E. B. Stuart the Army of Northern Virginia
has lost one of its most brilliant, enthusiastic
and zealous military leaders, the Southern cause
one of its earliest, most untiring and devoted
supporters, and the Cavalry arm of the service
a chieftain who first gave it prominence and
value, and whose dazzling achievements have
attracted the wonder and applause of distant
nations. His spirit shone as bright and brave
in the still chamber of death, as amid the
storm of the battlefield, and he passed out of
life the same buoyant hero he had lived. Blessed
through a short but glorious career with many
instances of almost miraculous good fortune, it
was his great privilege to die with the consciousness
of having performed his whole duty
to his country. To his children he leaves the
rich legacy of a name which has become identified
with the brightest acts of our military
history and, when the panorama of our battles
shall be unfolded to posterity, in almost every
picture will be seen the form of our gallant
leader. His name will be associated with
almost every scene of danger and of glory, in
which the Cavalry of the Virginia Army has
borne a part, and they will recount the exploits
of Stuart with the pride which men feel in their
own honorable records.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Major General commanding hopes that
this division will show by their own noble conduct
their high appreciation of the character of
their lost commander, and when the danger
thickens around them and the cause of their
country calls for heroic efforts they will remember
the example of Stuart. No leader ever set a
more glorious example to his soldiers on the
battlefield than he did, and it becomes the men
he has so often led, while they mourn his fall, to
emulate his courage, to imitate his heroic devotion
to duty and to avenge his death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>While General Lee and his army continued to
wrestle with the hosts of Grant, the city of
Richmond was in deep gloom and mourning.
Once more the tide of battle had come near her
gates; and this time the beloved and gallant
Stuart had fallen. He had been the pride of her
heart, her brave and chivalrous defender. But
Stuart was to sleep his last long sleep upon her
bosom, in beautiful Hollywood around whose
promontories sweep the waters of the James as
they rush onward to the Chesapeake and where
the tall pine trees whisper of the life eternal.
The city aroused herself from her grief to do
homage to the noble dead.</p>
<p>The City Council of Richmond passed resolutions
of respect and sympathy for the family
of General Stuart and asked that the body of
him who &ldquo;yielded up his heroic spirit in the
immediate defense of their city, and the successful
effort to purchase their safety by the sacrifice
of his own life,&rdquo; might &ldquo;be permitted to
rest under the eye and guardianship of the
people of Richmond and that they might be allowed
to commemorate by a suitable monument
their gratitude and his services.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of May 13, the
funeral of General Stuart took place from old
St. James Church in Richmond. The coffin containing
the remains of the brave soldier was
carried up the aisle and, covered with wreaths
and flowers, was placed before
the altar.</p>
<p>The funeral service was conducted
by Reverend Dr. Peterkin
who had been with General
Stuart during his last hours.
The church was filled with officials
of the Confederate government
and citizens of Richmond.
President Davis sat near the
front, with a look of great sadness
upon his careworn face.
His cabinet officers were around
him and on either side of the
church were the senators and
representatives of the Confederate
Congress. But the cavalry
officers and soldiers who loved
and followed Stuart were all
absent. They were on the firing
line, either in the Wilderness or
on the Chickahominy,&mdash;fighting
in defense of Richmond which
he had died to save.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic34">

<p class="caption">MONUMENT
<br />Marking Stuart&rsquo;s grave in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Va.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>No military escort could be
spared from the front to accompany the funeral
procession to Hollywood or to fire the usual
parting salute to the dead commander. But
as the body was lowered into the grave, the
earth trembled with the roar of artillery from
the battlefield where his old troops were obeying
his last command and driving back the
Federals. No better salute could have been
given the gallant leader.</p>
<p>Leaving the body of their brave defender
beneath the pines of Hollywood, the officials and
citizens of Richmond returned to their homes
to meet other sorrows. Before a year passed, the
devoted city was overtaken by the fate which
Stuart had so ably aided Lee in averting.
Richmond fell into the hands of the Federals,
General Lee surrendered, and the southern Confederacy
was no more.</p>
<p>When the city arose from her ashes and
again put on the garb of peace, one of her first
works was to erect memorials in honor of
the men who had fought so nobly in her defense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>In 1888, a monument was erected by some of
Stuart&rsquo;s comrades to mark the place at Yellow
Tavern where he received his mortal wound.
Governor Fitzhugh Lee was the orator of the
occasion. He had been one of Stuart&rsquo;s most
trusted brigadier generals, and had known him
since they were cadets together at West Point.
In beautiful and touching language, he reviewed
the chief
events of Stuart&rsquo;s
life, his brilliant
campaigns, and his
last hours.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic35">

<p class="caption">MONUMENT AT YELLOW TAVERN
<br />Marking the place where Stuart was wounded</p>
</div>
<p>The shaft at Yellow
Tavern is
twenty-two feet
high and stands
on a knoll about
thirty feet from
the spot where
Stuart was wounded.
Upon it are
the following inscriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Face</i>: Upon this field, Major-Genl. J. E. B. Stuart, Commander Confederate Cavalry A. N. Va., received his mortal wound, May 11, 1864.</dt></dl>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Right</i>: He was fearless and faithful, pure and powerful, tender and true.</dt></dl>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Left</i>: This stone is erected by some of his comrades to commemorate his valor.</dt></dl>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Rear</i>: He saved Richmond, but he gave his life. Born Feb. 6, 1833, died May 12, 1864.</dt></dl>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>In 1891, the &ldquo;Veteran Cavalry Association of
the Army of Northern Virginia&rdquo; was organized
for the purpose of marking the grave of General
Stuart with a suitable monument; but it was
afterwards decided that, with the aid of the city
of Richmond, the association would erect an
equestrian statue. The city donated the site on
Monument avenue, near the equestrian statue
of General Lee, and also contributed a large
sum of money, so that the association was
enabled to erect the statue.</p>
<p>The sculptor, Mr. Fred Moynihan, designed
and executed a statue, which is an excellent
likeness of General Stuart and a striking
example of the sculptor&rsquo;s skill. In 1907, the
memorial was unveiled in the presence of an
immense concourse of people, including large
numbers of veterans from all parts of the South.
Chief among the guests of honor were Miss Mary
Custis Lee, Mrs. Stonewall Jackson, and Mrs.
J. E. B. Stuart.</p>
<p>Fully ten thousand men marched in the
column which took over an hour to pass a
given point. Veterans who were too feeble to
endure the fatigue of the march went early to
the monument, and joined the great multitude
that crowded the sidewalks and even the housetops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>When the parade reached the monument, the
crowd was so dense that it was with difficulty
that the police made way for the orator and
distinguished guests. The multitude was called
to order by Major Andrew R. Venable, of
Farmville, Virginia, a member of the staff of
General Stuart, who introduced Rev. Walter Q.
Hullihen, of Staunton, Virginia, another member
of Stuart&rsquo;s staff, who made the dedicatory
prayer. Major Venable then introduced the
orator of the day, Judge Theodore S. Garnett
of Norfolk, Virginia, another member of the
staff of General Stuart.</p>
<p>It was indeed a remarkable incident that
three of General Stuart&rsquo;s staff officers presided
at the unveiling of his statue forty-three years
after his death.</p>
<p>Judge Garnett in an eloquent speech reviewed
the life and campaigns of Stuart, paying glowing
tributes to the general, to the &ldquo;ever-glorious
and gallant&rdquo; Stuart Horse Artillery, and to his
comrades of Mosby&rsquo;s Battalion. He closed
with these words: &ldquo;To the city of Richmond, as
its faithful guardian, we commit this monument,
in whose care and keeping it will henceforth
stand in token of a people&rsquo;s gratitude and in
perpetual memory of his heroic name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The veil was then drawn from the monument
by the hand of little Virginia Stuart Waller,
General Stuart&rsquo;s granddaughter. As the canvas
fell from the heroic figure of General Stuart
mounted on his powerful horse, the guns of the
Howitzers boomed a salute and the cheering
of the vast throng arose in billows of sound.</p>
